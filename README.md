TDL
===========================

Code for the Tufts Digital Library

At the moment if you've set up https://github.com/TuftsUniversity/epigaea appending
run `bundle exec rake hydra:server` from that project, this app will share the
same Solr and Fedora instance.   

TODO:
 * Add to travis
 * Add local server rake task for testing independently
