WHO HAVE MADE THE HISTORY OF TUFTS COLLEGE,

AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATE THIS BOOK.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>IN placing this book before the public, the publishers
are well aware that they have undertaken a difficult
task, but the time has come when the story of TUFTS
COLLEGE should be told; and although the telling of it
has necessitated an amount of earnest work which students burdened with the assignments of the class-room
can scarcely afford to bestow, the Editors, having entered
upon the work, have done their best, in the hope that
their efforts may not be altogether devoid of benefit to
their Alma Mater. The results of their work must of
necessity fall far short of their aims; but every available
source of information has been consulted, and no pains
have been spared to make the details given as accurate
as possible. Doubtless errors have crept in, and if any
are discovered corrections will be gratefully received.
In compiling the biographical directory every possible
means has been employed to render it complete, and any
deficiencies are due rather to indifference on the part
of those whose cooperation has been requested than to

<pb n="viii" id="p.viii"/>
carelessness on the part of those having the matter in
charge.</p>
<p>To those who have lent their aid to the work, the
Editors wish to offer their acknowledgments and
heartiest thanks. The Editor-in-Chief wishes especially
to express his gratitude to Professor WILLIAM    R.
SHIPMAN, through whose patient and careful review
of all the manuscript many an error has been
eliminated.</p>

<head>CHAPTER FIRST: THE FOUNDING OF THE COLLEGE.</head>

<p>MANY forces have operated toward the development of
higher education in America; but it may be confidently stated that it is to its religious organizations that this
country is indebted for the majority of its more advanced
institutions of learning. While of late years, in the West
especially, numerous universities have been opened with the
direct support of the States, and on the other hand many
an institution owes its foundation to the disinterested generosity of some wealthy friend of education, a careful examination of facts shows that nearly all the older universities
and colleges owe their inception primarily to the zeal of the
various religious denominations which have taken root on
American soil.</p>
<p>It is from that body of Christians known as the Universalists that Tufts College derives its being. Naturally, the
need of an educated ministry was the spring which first set
the wheels in motion; but it was also early felt that Universalism owed its contribution to the educational interest of the
country.</p>
<p>Proselyting, which was much more extended among schools
and colleges than it is to-day, furnished a sharp spur to those
of liberal belief toward the founding of an institution where
the simple pursuit of truth, and not conversion to any <pb n="16" id="p.16"/>particular religious tenets, should be the object sought. Toward the
middle of the present century the idea became more and more
prevalent that it did not pay to send young men from Universalist families to colleges under the control of other denominations: for there was no certainty that the liberal youth,
who entered one of the orthodox institutions with the earnest
intention of devoting his education and abilities to the faith
of his parents, would not receive his degree holding altogether
different opinions.</p>
<p>It is interesting at the present day to glance over the
articles which were written on this subject by prominent
Universalists in the early forties. Numerous instances were
cited of fine young men who, sent to evangelical colleges at
the most susceptible age, had come forth either so hardened
in bigotry as to believe their own parents to be utterly lost,
or else so disgusted by attempts made at their conversion as
to be confirmed atheists and scoffers.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Harvard appeared to be the
only available institution, and the majority were debarred
from attending there by the expense. Besides, many felt that
the Cambridge university was far too near the temptations of
a great city.</p>
<p>And yet higher education from some source was necessary,
in order that children of Universalist parentage should be
able to keep abreast of their more orthodox fellows, and the
liberal church be provided with leaders of equal culture with
those of the older faiths. General sentiment was therefore
fully aroused for action when, in the spring of 1847, the Rev.
Thomas J. Sawyer, of New York City, opened a correspondence
with the Rev. Hosea Ballou, 2d, of Medford, Massachusetts,
and the Rev. Thomas Whittemore, of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, then editor of the "Trumpet and Universalist
Magazine," respecting the ways and means for inaugurating
an educational movement in the denomination. As a result
of this correspondence, Mr. Sawyer issued a circular, which

<pb n="17" id="p.17"/>
was copied into the "Trumpet," of April 17, 1847, calling
for an "Educational Convention" to meet in the Orchard
Street Church, New York City, on Tuesday, the 18th of May
following.</p>
<p>The convention met according to the summons, and was
called to order at ten o'clock A. M., a large attendance evincing
the interest felt in the movement. James Hall, Esq., of New
York City, was chosen moderator, and the Rev. L. C. Brown,
of Norwich, Connecticut, secretary. The meeting was opened
with prayer by the Rev. Hosea Ballou. The Rev. Messrs.
Sawyer, Whittemore, and Ballou, 2d, were appointed a committee on business, and presented for consideration the following questions: 1. " Do Universalists need a college ? " and
2. " Shall we at this time make an earnest effort to answer the
wants of the denomination in regard to a college?" Both
of these questions were answered unanimously in the affirmative, and resolutions were passed declaring it "expedient that
means at once be devised for the establishment of a college
to meet the wants of the denomination," and " that the said
college be located in the Valley of the Hudson or Mohawk
River." This location seemed to be quite generally agreed
upon by those interested, there being some idea that the
Clinton Liberal Institute might be made a basis for the new
college. The selection of a definite site was left to a board
of trustees, elected at the same meeting. This first board of
trustees -five members of which it was voted should constitute a quorum-was made up of the following gentlemen, than
whom none could have been found more enthusiastic over the
cause in which they were engaged: the Rev. Calvin Gardner,
of Maine; J. Burley, Esq., of New Hampshire; the Rev. Eli
Ballou, of Vermont; B. B. Mussey, Esq., and the Rev. Thomas
Whittemore, of Massachusetts; the Rev. T. J. Greenwood, of
Connecticut; Dr. Jacob Harsen, the Revs. S. R. Smith, T. J.
Sawyer, and Dolphus Skinner, B. Ellis, Esq., and Josiah Barber, Esq., of New York; Col. J. Kingsbury, and Elijah Dallet,

<pb n="18" id="p.18"/>
Esq., of Pennsylvania, and Dr. E. Crosby, of Ohio. The Rev.
Otis A. Skinner, of Boston, and the Rev. Dolphus Skinner, of
New York, were appointed agents to solicit funds for the
college; and the name of the Rev. W. S. Balch, of New York,
was afterward added, while a committee was appointed with
power to make such further arrangements for soliciting funds
as its members should deem necessary.  The Rev. Hosea
Ballou, 2d, declared that one hundred thousand dollars was
absolutely necessary, and must be pledged before any definite
operations could be commenced.</p>
<p>To raise such a sum was at that time no slight undertaking.
While the tie that bound together the Universalists throughout the land was a strong one, there had never been in the
denomination any concerted action for any particular purpose,
and no general call had ever been made for any considerable
sum of money. The agents, therefore, had before them an
untried field. But while there was some apprehension, there
was no shrinking among these earnest men. It was voted
that all subscriptions should be binding when one hundred
thousand dollars should be pledged; and the vote was cast
with a firm determination that the money should be forthcoming at no very distant date. The convention also decided to
establish a theological seminary, and appointed a committee
with instructions "to correspond with the brethren of different sections in reference to the most suitable place for its
location." The assembly then adjourned, to meet again in
New York City on the Friday after the ensuing meeting of the
United States Universalist Convention, at nine o'clock A. M.</p>
<p>
The General Convention assembled on the 14th of September, 1847, in the Orchard Street Church, New York City; and
on the morning of Wednesday, the fifteenth, the Rev. Dr.
Ballou, of Medford, preached the occasional sermon, taking
as his text the last clause of the forty-eighth verse of the
twelfth chapter of Luke: " Unto whomsoever much is given
of him shall much be required; and to whom men have <pb n="19" id="p.19"/>committed much of them will they ask the more." The church
was crowded to overflowing; and, although the aisles were
literally filled with chairs, seating accommodations could not
be furnished for all the people. "It was an exciting spectacle." The subject which Dr. Ballou drew from his text was,
"The responsibility of Universalists in the position they now
hold before God and the world." Never had the Doctor been
more eloquent than upon this occasion. He seemed to be
completely carried away by his subject, and his enthusiasm
communicated itself to his hearers. The following, which
appeared in the "Trumpet," is authority for the latter
statement:</p>
<p>"The large audience were kept intensely interested for nearly
an hour and a half, and those who were obliged to stand during
the whole delivery declared, many of them, that not a single
thought of their position entered into their minds during the
whole discourse."</p>
<p>Toward the end of his discourse, the speaker made a
powerful plea for education. He had hoped, he said, to see
the denomination take up this important work, and to be able
to aid in it himself; "but," said he, "the night is coming
down, in which no man can work. The shadows of age are
already on these eyes, and nothing is done. If we make an
effort, it is like men striving in a troubled dream. There is a
nightmare on our limbs; the muscles will not move at our
volition. When shall we wake from our frightful slumber ?
Shall we ever throw off the smothering incubus which has
held us so long that it threatens death?"</p>
<p>To his impassioned eloquence the orator added much that
was practical; and his words bore fruit in an enthusiastic
meeting of the Educational Convention on the following
Friday. At this meeting it was deemed expedient to rescind
the vote appointing two or more agents to solicit funds, and to
place the matter in the sole charge of one competent agent.
The business committee subsequently intrusted the work to

<pb n="20" id="p.20"/>
the Rev. Otis A. Skinner. With noble enthusiasm this gentleman at once set about his arduous task, visiting Universalists
throughout the country and making vigorous public appeals
through the press, until, under the date of April 21, 1851,
he issued notice that he should begin to collect the money
subscribed. The death or business failure of some of the
subscribers, he said, had somewhat reduced the amount which
could actually be collected; and the total amount then subscribed was but $97,000. But, confident that the balance
could easily be raised among the few persons whom he had
not yet visited, Mr. Skinner himself subscribed the $3,000
necessary to make the subscriptions binding. By the terms
of subscription every sum pledged was to be paid in four
equal instalments at intervals of six months. There were
subscribers in New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio.</p>
<p>A meeting of the subscribers was held in Boston on September 16, 1851, at which the matter of a site for the college
was discussed.</p>
<p>On the 19th and 20th of the following November, the
trustees met and elected the following officers: President,
the Rev. T. J. Sawyer, of Clinton, New York; Treasurer, B. B.
Mussey, Esq., of Boston; Secretary, the Rev. O. A. Skinner, of
Boston. It was reported that the amount already subscribed
exceeded the requisite one hundred thousand dollars, and that
all the subscriptions were legal. "All hearts are cheered,"
says the " Trumpet" in its published report of the meeting.
A committee on location reported having received very favorable offers regarding a place not yet visited by them, and
after some discussion the subject was referred to them again
for further investigation.</p>
<p>The place mentioned was a tract of twenty acres comprising Walnut Hill, a portion of the farm of Mr. Charles Tufts
of Somerville, Massachusetts. The hill itself was upon the
boundary line between Somerville and Medford, and it is

<pb n="21" id="p.21"/>
reported that Mr. Tufts, when asked by a friend what he
intended to do with the wind-swept height, replied, "I will
put a light on it," - a remark which has become one of the
traditions of the college which now bears his name.</p>
<p>For some weeks it was undecided whether the new college
should be located on the site offered by Mr. Tufts, or at
Franklin, about twenty-five miles from Boston, where liberal
money offers from Mr. Oliver Dean of that town invited its
location.</p>
<p>It was finally agreed, however, as the offer of Mr. Tufts
was in land and furnished an exceptionally fine situation, to
locate the college upon Walnut Hill. It was believed that
Mr. Dean would be above the influence of any local prejudice,
and would give liberally to the institution in any event; and
the future proved this belief to be well founded, for his gifts
aggregated nearly a hundred thousand dollars, besides which
he founded Dean Academy at Franklin, as a preparatory
school for Tufts College.</p>
<p>After the acceptance of Walnut Hill as a site for the
college, Mr. Tufts increased his gift by the addition of adjoining tracts, until its total reached a hundred acres, largely in
Somerville. This tract was further increased by a gift of
twenty acres from Mr. Timothy Cotting, of Medford.</p>
<p>Other names which stand conspicuous among those of the
men who may be said to have laid the financial basis of the
college, are those of Sylvanus Packard, of Boston, Thomas A.
Goddard, of Boston, and Dr. William J. Walker, of Charlestown.</p>
<p>Mr. Packard's initial gift was his bond for twenty thousand
dollars, upon which he agreed to pay four per cent during
his life. This, however, is lost sight of in his subsequent
liberality, for, after continual donations during his life, he
bequeathed his entire estate of about three hundred thousand
dollars to the college, at his death in 1866.</p>
<p>Messrs. Walker and Goddard were liberal donors to the
<pb n="22" id="p.22"/>

initial fund, but the gifts for which they are most to be
remembered belong to another chapter.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Packard's legacy made his donation in the
end the largest which the college has received from any one
person, Mr. Tufts' gift and pledges made him, in the beginning, the largest donor, and as the college was situated upon
his land, it was very appropriately resolved to give it his
name.</p>
<p>The charter of Tufts College received the signature of
N. P. Banks, Jr., Speaker of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives, on April 15, 1852; that of Henry Wilson,
President of the Senate, on April 21; and, also on April 21,
that of His Excellency, G. S. Boutwell, Governor. The
charter originally granted the right to confer all degrees
except those in medicine, but this restriction was removed
in 1867.</p>
<p>Immediately upon obtaining the charter, the work of establishing the college was begun.  At a meeting of the
Trustees, July 21, 1852, B. B. Mussey, O. A. Skinner, and
Timothy Cotting were appointed a committee to " devise a
plan for college buildings with all consistent dispatch," and
the Revs. Hosea Ballou, 2d, T. J. Sawyer, O. A. Skinner, and
L. R. Paige were appointed to draw up the outlines of a system
of instruction.</p>
<p>At this meeting it was also voted to choose a president for
the college, and the Rev. T. J. Sawyer, D. D., of Clinton, New
York, was at once unanimously elected. Great satisfaction
was expressed, both in the denominational and general press,
with the choice of the trustees. Only one man doubted Dr.
Sawyer's fitness for the position, and that man was the Doctor
himself. In those early days of the young institution it was
necessary that the President should also be an active financial
agent, and it was on this account that Dr. Sawyer, after careful consideration, declined the honor which was offered him.
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00091.00001" id="f2"><head>Ballou hall</head></figure></p>

<pb n="23" id="p.23"/>
<p>Very fortunate were the trustees then in not having far
to seek before tendering the responsible office to another. In
the following May the presidency was offered to Dr. Sawyer's
most earnest and active co-worker, the Rev. Hosea Ballou, 2d,
D. D., of Medford, and was accepted by him with many misgivings, which, however, his administration more than proved
to be groundless.</p>
<p>Meanwhile building operations had been commenced at the
Hill, and on July 23, 1853, the corner-stone of the first college
building- now Ballou Hall - was laid with appropriate
exercises. The weather was all that could be desired. A
special train left Boston at nine o'clock in the forenoon, and
Mr. Yale of Boston had spread for the attending ladies a
large awning, above which floated three American flags.
From fifteen hundred to two thousand persons were present.
In the absence of Dr. Sawyer, Vice-President Whittemore of
the Trustees presided; the Scriptures were read by the Rev.
T. J. Greenwood; the Rev. A. A. Miner, who was to do so
much for the college later on, delivered the address; prayers
were offered by the Rev. Messrs. H. Bacon and W. H. Ryder;
and hymns were sung written for the occasion by Mrs. N. T.
Monroe and Mrs. Mary T. Goddard. The corner-stone was
laid by Dr. Ballou, president elect of the college.  The
Doctor is said to have been very particular that the fine
block of Connecticut sandstone should be laid absolutely fair
and true, - a fact which is symbolic of the care with which
he attended to each minutest detail of his work in connection
with the college and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dr. Ballou spent the next year in travelling through Europe
and preparing himself for his work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the building progressed. It was, and is, rectangular, one hundred feet long by sixty feet broad, three
finished stories in height, built in simple Italian style, of red-faced brick with sandstone trimmings. As originally planned
it contained, besides recitation rooms, dormitory, and bathing
<pb n="24" id="p.24"/>
accommodations, a chapel, library, and rooms for two literary
societies. The chapel and library were finished with stucco;
the other rooms were plain. In November, 1853, the roof
was completed; and on the nineteenth of the month, the
Rev. William A. Drew, Editor of the " Gospel Banner," sat
down beneath a window in the unfinished chapel, and, using
a board for his table, inscribed beneath a quotation from
Horace what were probably the first written words to proceed
from the halls of the new seat of learning.</p>

<p>"Doctrina nunc vim promovet in sitam,
Rectique cultis pectora roborant;
Utcumque defecere mores,
Indecorant bene nata culpae."</p>

<p>"Sacred to a progressive literature and to an enlightened
piety be this place ! May light from the Supreme Intelligence,
and the spirit of him who was its holiest image, illuminate
and sanctify these halls, ever ! This is our prayer to Heaven;
and could our wishes reach the pupils who may, through long
coming years, throng hither, we would admonish them, according to the Latin sentiment above expressed, that the
highest office of learning is to refine the mind, to fortify the
virtues, and retain in vivid beauty and power the impress of
the divine Father's character in his human children."</p>
<p>It had been intended to open the college with the fall term
of 1854, but it was finally decided to postpone the formal
opening until the next year, when a large boarding-house, as
well as the main building, would be completed. During the
year 1854-55, however, three students, William N. Eayrs,
Harvey Hersey, and Edward K. Sampson, were residents at
the Hill, pursuing their studies under the tuition of Dr. Ballou
and Prof. J. P. Marshall, the present senior member and Dean
of the Faculty, who was a most able assistant to President
Ballou in the work of organization.</p>
<p>The second and last regular examination for admission
prior to the opening of the college, was held on Saturday,
<pb n="25" id="p.25"/>

August 18, 1855, and the formal opening of the institution was
announced for the following Wednesday, the twenty-second.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in February, 1855, an association had been
formed which did much good work in raising funds for the
college. It was composed of parishes, auxiliary and religious
societies, and was known as the " Tufts College Educational
Association." Dr. Miner was its President, and was ably
assisted by an interested and efficient corps of officers and
directors.  Many large amounts flowed into the college
treasury through this association. The parish at Plymouth
gave $1400 not long after its organization.</p>
<p>The day upon which Tufts College was to be introduced
to the world of letters, dawned bright and beautiful, warm
and sunny without being oppressively hot, -an ideal summer
day. The exercises had been advertised to begin at half past
ten in the forenoon. By nine o'clock people began to arrive,
and before the appointed hour the building was thronged;
and at eleven o'clock a delayed special train brought about
six hundred more persons from Boston. It was impossible
to give seating accommodations to the immense crowd, and
many could not even get into the building, which was crowded
from basement to roof. The audience certainly deserved
praise for the good nature which it displayed, for it was
palpably a mistake to hold the exercises in the chapel when
the weather was doing its best to make things inviting out
of doors. After the arrival of the train it was discovered
that Mr. and Mrs. Tufts were not present, owing to its
failure to stop at Somerville. A committee was appointed
to fetch them post-haste in a carriage, and at last all was
ready to begin.</p>
<p>While the Germania Band of Boston furnished music, a
procession was formed in the south-west corner of the basement and proceeded upstairs to the chapel. There the Rev.
Henry Bacon, of Philadelphia, offered prayer, and in the

<pb n="26" id="p.26"/>

absence of Dr. Oliver Dean, President of the Trustees, Vice
President Rev. Thomas Whittemore installed President
Ballou and Professors John P. Marshall, William P. Drew,
and Benjamin F. Tweed, the first faculty of the college.</p>
<p>President Ballou then delivered his inaugural address, and
the closing prayer was offered by the Rev. E. Fisher, of
Dedham.</p>
<p>After the chapel exercises, dinner was served, the tent
of Mr. Yale, who acted as assistant marshal, being again
brought into requisition. Nine hundred plates had been provided, and hundreds who attempted to obtain tickets at the
last moment were refused. An hour and a half was occupied
in seating the company, and an hour more was consumed in
gastronomic exercise. The caterer was J. B. Smith, of Boston,
and the " Trumpet," in enthusiastic praise, says that the tables
were served " bountifully as one could have them in his own
house."</p>
<p>After the feasting was concluded Dr. Ballou spoke a few
well-chosen words of welcome, after which the first toast:
" Charles Tufts, the venerable founder of Tufts College:
may the fruition of his project gladden his heart through all
his earthly journey!" was answered by the company rising
and giving three enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>" The founding of the first Universalist college in the world,
the success of this enterprise must be as gratifying to the
numerous donors as it is honorable to the indefatigable agent:"
was responded to by the Rev. Otis A. Skinner, who told the
story of his work, in which there was much of interest. One
pleasant little anecdote was that of Mr. F-, a gentleman
of Charlestown, who had agreed to give one hundred dollars
through each of his four nephews. Before the time for payment arrived another nephew had been added to the original
quartette, and Mr. F   said to Mr. Skinner, " I see no way
but that I must add another hundred dollars to the donation,
as I want to treat them all alike."</p>
<pb n="27" id="p.27"/>

<p>The Rev. E. H. Chapin, of New York, responded to the
toast: "Knowledge is Power,- an aphorism verified in the
undisputed dominion of the Christian orator;" and so eloquent did Dr. Chapin become that many pledges of financial
aid are said to have resulted from his speech.</p>
<p>The fourth toast was: "The Tufts College Educational
Association, - the channel through which may flow the sympathies of the people for our infant institution !" In response
to this, the Rev. A. A. Miner, of Boston, read a letter in which
Mr. Sylvanus Packard, of Boston, already the donor of twenty
thousand dollars, gave his promise to duplicate the next
three ten thousands raised outside of those who were already
contributors.</p>
<p>"The Treasurer of Tufts College," was the next toast.
"The treasury being empty we this day draw on the Treasurer, who will honor our draft at sight." B. B. Mussey, Esq.,
rose amid cheers and stamping, and proved the treasury not
empty by showing that out of forty-five thousand dollars
received for building expenses, but forty thousand dollars had
been paid out, leaving five thousand dollars in the treasury.</p>
<p>After a thrilling speech by the Rev. T. B. Thayer, of Lowell,
an appeal for funds was started by the ever ready Mr. Packard,
who gave another five hundred dollars, immediately matched
by an equal sum from Mr. Mussey. The total amount subscribed at the dinner was about four thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The exercises were concluded by singing, "From all that
dwell below the skies;" and the first great gala day in the
history of Tufts College came joyfully to a close.</p>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="CHAPTER SECOND: PRESIDENT BALLOU'S ADMINISTRATION" id="c3s2">
<head>CHAPTER SECOND:PRESIDENT BALLOU'S ADMINISTRATION.</head>

<p>THE next day, Thursday, August twenty-third, regular
work at the college began. President Ballou gave
instruction in History and Intellectual Philosophy, Professor
Marshall in Mathematics and Physical Science, Professor
Drew in the Ancient Languages, and Professor Tweed in
Rhetoric, Logic, and English Literature. Enoch C. Rolfe,
M.D., had been appointed Instructor in Physiology and
Hygiene. Twenty-one students entered the Freshman Class,
and, including the four young men who had been studying at
the Hill during the previous year, there were six Sophomores
and three Juniors, making a total of thirty students.</p>
<p>During President Ballou's administration only one course of
study was offered, -that leading to the degree of Bachelor
of Arts, and nearly all the work of the course was prescribed.
In the original arrangement of the curriculum, work in
Greek and Latin was required for two years and a half; in
Mathematics for two years; in History for three years; and
in Rhetoric for four years. A half year's work in Moral
Science, a year's work in Physical Science, and a year's
work in Natural and Revealed Religion completed the prescribed studies. Work in the Modern Languages was entirely
elective.</p>
<p>In Latin, the Freshmen read Livy and Horace, with supplementary exercises in Prose Composition and the study
of Antiquities; the Sophomores continued the reading of
Horace, taking in addition the De Amicitia and the De

<pb n="29" id="p.29"/>

Officiis of Cicero; the Satires of Juvenal were required in
the first term of the Junior year, and Tacitus and Seneca
were offered as elective work in the second term.</p>
<p> In Greek, the Freshmen studied Felton's Greek Historians,
with exercises in Antiquities, Grammar, Composition, and
written translation; the Sophomores read Demosthenes in
the first term, and Aristophanes with a study of Greek Metres
in the second term; the Juniors read &#x00C6;schylus in the first
term, and might elect a course in Pindar and &#x00C6;schylus in
the second term.</p>
<p> In Mathematics the Freshmen studied Algebra, and went
through five books of Euclid; the Sophomores took up Plane
and Spherical Trigonometry, Surveying, Navigation, and
Calculus, while advanced work might be elected in the
Junior year.</p>
<p> In History, Weber's Outlines was the principal text-book
used. Ancient History was studied during the Freshman
year; the Sophomore year was devoted to a consideration
of the Middle Ages and the period prior to the colonization
of America; and in the Junior year the period from the
colonization of America to the French Revolution was taken
under discussion. This historical course is deserving of
special mention. At that time History was scarcely recognized as a college study. Books were written; they might
be read; that was enough. Dr. Ballou, however, saw more
clearly than the majority of his contemporaries the educational value of the subject. A profound historical scholar
himself, he could thoroughly appreciate the value of a
knowledge of the past in dealing with the problems of the
present. He was singularly advanced in his methods of
instruction, and made the utmost of the meagre facilities at
his disposal. Meeting the class four times each week for
three years, he offered a course far superior to that of any
other institution in the country at the time. When he died
there was no one else in whose hands the course could be

<pb n="30" id="p.30"/>
placed, so it dropped from the curriculum; and, although
for eight years during the administration of Dr. Miner the
scholarly Richard Frothingham offered a course of historical
lectures, more than thirty years were to elapse before the
institution of a regular department of History.</p>
<p> The required work in Rhetoric began with English Grammar, included Oratory, and extended over the entire course.
Day's Rhetoric was used as a text-book, and themes and
declamations were required. Revealed Religion formed a
part of the curriculum in the first term of the Sophomore
year, being replaced in the second term by a course of
lectures on Physiology. Physics, Moral Science, Astronomy,
Intellectual Philosophy, Logic, and lectures on Hygiene
were included in the requirements of the Junior year. The
Juniors also had the privilege of electing, besides the courses
in Mathematics and the Classics already mentioned, French
and lectures on Natural History in the first term, and French
and Italian in the second term. In lieu of a regular
instructor in Modern Languages, Professor Marshall directed
what little work was done in the department during this first
year.</p>
<p> The requirements for admission were substantially the
same as those of Harvard, but many young men coming from
the country with a poor preparation were admitted under
heavy conditions, provided they showed themselves capable
of carrying on the college work.</p>
<p> The first catalogue was issued in 1854-55; the second (1856-
57) was a pamphlet of 16 pp., and showed a few changes
in the curriculum, the principal one being in the department
of Mathematics. The required work in this subject was considerably expanded, being extended throughout the Junior
year. As but little was added to the course the gain was
in thoroughness of instruction. Some slight changes were
made in the departments of Latin and Greek, and the practice
of translating Latin into Greek and Greek into Latin was

<pb n="31" id="p.31"/>
introduced into the classical work of the Junior Class. The
lectures on Physiology and Hygiene were discontinued,
together with those on Natural History; but work in the
Modern Languages was greatly facilitated by the appointment of Jerome Schneider, Ph. D., as an instructor.</p>
<p> The opening of this year saw the first Senior Class at Tufts
College. Its work included Chemistry, Intellectual Philosophy, Political Economy, Logic, Forensics, Mineralogy
and Geology, Natural and Revealed Religion, and Rhetoric,
with opportunity for the election of Latin, Greek, German,
and Spanish.</p>
<p> From this time until the death of Dr. Ballou but few
changes of any importance were made in the curriculum.
Considered separately they amounted to nothing, but taken
as a whole they showed a tendency toward progress. In
1860 the requirement in Mathematics was reduced to two
years, and some other minor indications of increasing
liberality were observable. In 1857 Professor Drew resigned
his position, and Alpheus A. Keen, A. M., a graduate of
Harvard, was appointed Professor of Ancient Languages
and Classical Literature. In 1860 he was relieved of a
portion of the classical work by the appointment of Dr.
Schneider as Professor of the Greek Language and Literature.
Professor Schneider did not, however, relinquish his care of
the Modern Languages until 1869.</p>
<p> By the year 1856-57, the number of students matriculated at the college had become approximately what it
remained for several years. The Class entering in 1856
numbered fifteen, while the Sophomore Class, having lost
two of its members, numbered nineteen. The Junior Class
had gained three members, making nine; and the Senior
Class one, making four, while six students were receiving
instruction in partial courses. Thus the total number of
students during the third year of the existence of the college


<pb n="32" id="p.32"/>

was fifty-three. The next year it dropped to fifty, and the
next year to forty-nine, rising to fifty-eight in the year
1859-60, and returning to fifty-three in the year 1860-61.</p>
<p> The first Commencement exercises were held on July 8,
1857, when three young men received the Bachelor's degree,
- Heman A. Dearborn, of Weare, New Hampshire, William
N. Eayrs, of Boston, Massachusetts, and Harvey Hersey, of
Calais, Vermont. At the Chapel exercises in the forenoon
the Latin Salutatory was given by Mr. Hersey, the Philosophical Oration on the "Study of Man," by Mr. Eayrs,
and the Valedictory by Mr. Dearborn. Great enthusiasm
was shown during the exercises, and the "Boston Journal"
records that "the President, calm as he is ordinarily, was
at times moved to tears." The Commencement dinner was
served in a large tent, and a long list of toasts met with
enthusiastic responses. At three o'clock in the afternoon
special exercises were held under the auspices of the
Mathetican Society. It is recorded that this day, like all
the college festival days which had preceded it, was beautiful, bright, and clear. The college was not so fortunate in
its next Commencement, however, for the day was characterized by a most unpleasant drizzling rain. The chapel was
so crowded that many could not obtain admission, and the
"Trumpet" says that "the ladies with enlarged skirts found
themselves in a peculiarly inconvenient situation." At this
second Commencement the entire class of nine members
received the degree, and for the next four years no student
who had attained to Senior standing failed to graduate.</p>
<p> During the six years of Dr. Ballou's administration, from
1855 to 1861, one hundred and eight students registered in
the regular course, and twelve in partial courses, while forty-seven men received the degree of Bachelor of Arts.</p>
<p> The college year was originally divided into two terms, of
which the first began six weeks after the second Wednesday
in July, and ended on the second Wednesday in January,
<pb n="33" id="p.33"/>

while the second began six weeks after the second Wednesday in January and continued until Commencement, which
occurred on the second Wednesday in July. In addition to
the two vacations of six weeks each, the exercises of the
college were suspended for six days at Thanksgiving, on
Christmas Day, Fast Day, and the Fourth of July, and
on the Wednesday and Thursday of Anniversary Week.
Students of good average standing were permitted to absent
themselves from the college for a period of six weeks in
addition to the Spring vacation for the purpose of teaching
school, provided that they continued their college studies
during the time.</p>
<p> Public examinations of all the classes, lasting at least
four days, were held twice each year. In the second term a
Junior Exhibition was held, in which parts were assigned
according to the standing of the students. It was preceded
by a rigorous examination, extending over a period of two
weeks, in which the Juniors were called to account for all
the work of the previous two years and a half. These
"Junior Grinds" were looked forward to with fear and
dread, and were responsible for the consumption of an enormous amount of midnight oil, not to speak of nervous
tissue.</p>
<p> The rules and regulations of the early days were somewhat
strict, as were those of all educational institutions at that
time, but President Ballou and Professor Marshall, who had
the principal oversight of the conduct of the students, were
men of kindness and moderation, and there is no record of
any of the young men feeling that they were particularly
oppressed. Example was deemed better than precept at that
day, and the Faculty as well as the students were required
to attend prayers in the morning, and divine service on
Sunday, Thanksgiving, and Fast Day. As at present,
students were permitted to attend church where they pleased,
provided the place of worship was reported to the Faculty.

<pb n="34" id="p.34"/>

Students were not permitted to leave the town of Medford,
in which their rooms were, without permission from the
Faculty. Just what happened to the youth who carelessly
strayed into the field across the Somerville line history does
not say, but there appear to have been no restrictions on the
use of the road to Medford Square. The college then, however, was much more a part of Medford than it is at present,
the establishment of a college post-office having made a vast
difference in that regard. President Ballou was a man who
loved quiet, and he did his utmost in a fatherly way to make
the behavior of the young men calm and decorous. Whistling is said to have been extremely distasteful to him, and
many were the gentle rebukes administered for this expression of exuberance. In spite of all rules, however, and in
spite of the dear old Doctor's solicitous care, numerous
escapades appear to have been indulged in, and the eyes of
many an old graduate twinkle to-day as he recalls the mischievous exploits of his college life. Hazing was indulged
in, but it was of a mild sort, the Sophomores usually contenting themselves with requiring nocturnal orations from
the Freshmen. The most rigorous stickler for good behavior
among college men can excuse much to those students of
forty years ago if he will but remember that there was at
that time no Glee Club, no foot-ball team, no tennis, and
even no base-ball, as the game is known to-day.</p>
<p> The first society formed among the students was the
Mathetican, a literary organization which owed its name to
Thomas H. Angell, of the class of 1858, who died only a year
after his graduation. Tradition makes the founding of the
society almost simultaneous with that of the college; at any
rate, it was full fledged in 1856. The Mathetican occupied
the northeast corner room on the third floor of College Hall.
The program of its meetings consisted of debates, essays,
and orations; and for many years it occupied an important
position in the life of the college. Special exercises were 
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.01042" id="f3"><head>Middle Hall, now the Library</head></figure>
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00460" id="f4"><head>Dean Hall and Goddard Gymnasium</head></figure>
<pb n="35" id="p.35"/>
held under its auspices upon public days. Some time in
1857-58 several members of the class of 1860, who were
dissatisfied with the way in which the affairs of the Mathetican were managed, instituted a rival society known as the
Walnut Hill Fraternity. The room on the northwest corner
was given up to this organization, and for a time it ran in
lively opposition to the older society. It was short-lived,
however, dying a natural death in less than three years. A
Theological Society was early established, its membership
being made up of those students who intended to enter the
ministry. Evening meetings were held each week, at which
regular religious services were conducted, followed by criticism. Two Greek-letter fraternities entered the college at
an early date, the Kappa Chapter of Zeta Psi being instituted
in 1855, and the Kappa Charge of Theta Delta Chi in 1856.
The entrance of secret fraternities could not fail to have
considerable effect on the life of the students. The two
chapters mentioned had the field to themselves for thirty
years, and there sprang up between them a rivalry which
was perhaps bitter at times, but which in the long run had
an invigorating influence on the life of the Hill. The year
1858 saw the birth of the Order of the Coffee-pot, which was
designed primarily as a graduate organization. Only students
of the two upper classes were eligible to membership. The
badge was of silver, having a coffee-pot engraved on one
side, and on the other the motto, Quum nobis placeat, cujus
refert. It was worn upon all public occasions, when meetings were held at which coffee was served.</p>
<p> The college was scarcely under way before an increase of
accommodation became an imperative necessity, and in 1856
the brick building, which has since been enlarged to form
the library, was erected at a total cost of $9,715.93. It was
arranged for a boarding-house and dormitory, and accommodated twenty-six students besides the steward and his family.
The college barn originally stood at the rear of this <pb n="36" id="p.36"/>building, and was not removed until the end of Dr. Miner's
administration, when it was torn down. The present barn
at the foot of Packard Avenue was originally the property of
Mr. Samuel Teel, and stood for many years on the spot now
occupied by the Commons Building. In the Summer of
1857 a two-story wooden dormitory, accommodating twelve
students, was built on the site of West Hall, and in 1860 the
large brick dormitory known as East Hall was erected. The
basement floor of this building was used as the college
Commons for many years.</p>
<p> In the Spring of 1856 Mr. Tufts formally transferred to
the college the additional tract of land which he had previously promised, and some other gifts were made at about
the same time. The report made by the financial committee
in September, 1856, showed that the college was in possession of sixty-eight acres of land and of buildings valued at
$51,600. The only other important contribution made during this period was the bequest of Colonel Wade, of Woburn.
This property, which is as yet only partially available, now
amounts to about fifty thousand dollars. Despite these liberal
gifts, however, the college was in a financial condition far from
sound, for the possession of land would not defray its running
expenses; and too much honor cannot be paid to Mr. Thomas
A. Goddard, who succeeded Mr. Mussey as Treasurer in 1856,
and filled the office until 1864. Mr. Goddard dreaded all
ostentation, and the extent of his munificence was probably
not realized at the time; but during the period of poverty
through which the college passed in its early years, he substantially defrayed its expenses from his private purse, paying out as much as six thousand dollars in a single year. In
another chapter will be shown how his generosity has been
continued through his widow, Mrs. Mary T. Goddard, whose
interest in the college was one with that of her husband.</p>
<p> When Professor Marshall came to Tufts, he brought with
him a small private collection of minerals and fossils which
<pb n="37" id="p.37"/>

he made the nucleus of a college museum, and it was not
long before, through his efforts, the little store of specimens
began to increase rapidly in size. Numerous gifts of scientific apparatus, books, etc., were also received from various
friends of the college.</p>
<p> Thus before the breaking out of the war Tufts College was
fairly launched on a career of prosperity. With a constantly
increasing equipment, with more than half a hundred
students, and with a corps of instructors whose ability had
been thoroughly demonstrated, everything pointed to a brilliant future for the young institution; but he to whose labors
this harvest was so largely due was not to live to see its
ripest fruitage. Dr. Ballou was a man of extreme conscientiousness and intense sensibility, and the cares of his
work, into which he had thrown himself with his whole
soul, and to which he had freely sacrificed his physical
repose, at length brought on an illness from which he died
on May 21, 1861. He passed away peacefully and trustingly
as he had lived, to take his place with those whose earthly
lives have been a constant help and a noble example to their
fellow-men.</p>
<p> Dr. Ballou's legacy to the college was his library, which
was a remarkably fine one for the time. The student of
to-day often finds upon the shelves volumes whose margins
are thickly annotated in a fine, scholarly hand. The fly-leaves bear the name of Hosea Ballou, and as one reads
those careful annotations, so indicative of painstaking
thought and lofty understanding, one cannot but think that
he who inscribed them must have been one who filled his
place in the world well, and one without whom our college
would scarcely be what it is to-day.</p>

<head>CHAPTER THIRD: PRESIDENT MINER'S ADMINISTRATION.</head>
<pb n="38" id="p.38"/>

<p>THE selection of a successor to Dr. Ballou was not an
easy task, and for a whole year the college remained
without an executive head. During this time, however, its
affairs were administered with great care and discretion
by Professor Marshall. Many men were suggested for the
presidency, and considered by the Trustees, among them
Professor Alpheus Crosby, who had been Professor of Greek
in Dartmouth College, and was at that time Principal of the
State Normal School for Girls at Salem, Massachusetts.
The name of Alonzo Ames Miner, D. D., was brought forward
by his parishioner, Sylvanus Packard, and met with ready
support from a large number of the Trustees. The finances
of the college were in a very low condition, and these members of the Board felt that Dr. Miner, with his splendid
executive ability and his tireless energy, was the man of
men to better the situation. They were not mistaken. The
presidency was offered to Dr. Miner in the Spring of 1862,
and he was inaugurated on the eleventh of July. He found
the college with an income of about one thousand dollars,
and a debt of eighteen thousand dollars, the latter increasing at the rate of five thousand dollars annually. When he
resigned the presidency the assets of the college amounted to
nearly a million dollars, although the expenses had greatly
increased and the resources had been diminished by the
Boston fire of 1872, and the flagging of manufacturing
industries in which college money was invested.</p>

<pb n="39" id="p.39"/>
<p> In becoming President Dr. Miner did not relinquish his
pastorate in Boston, and during the first three years of his
administration his services to the college were rendered
gratuitously. He continued to reside in the city, but came
to the Hill nearly every day, conducting the classes in
Ethics and Political Economy.</p>
<p> As an instructor he possessed many strong qualities, and
the influence of his powerful personality upon the young men
who came in contact with him was very great; but it is for
his wonderful work as an administrator that he is chiefly to
be remembered in connection with Tufts College. He was
well known as an able and active public man, and his
management of the affairs of the college inspired confidence
among men of wealth. Mention has already been made of
Sylvanus Packard, who had no children, and who was accustomed to point to his numerous buildings in the city, saying,
"These belong to my heir, Tufts College;" and of Thomas
A. Goddard, the large-hearted Treasurer of the college,
whose gifts were all the nobler for being so quietly bestowed.
Both these gentlemen were parishioners of Dr. Miner. It
was also during this period that Dr. William J. Walker of
Newport, Rhode Island, already a liberal donor, bequeathed
about $200,000 to the college. Dr. Walker was deeply
interested in Harvard University, and was not a Universalist
in belief; but he was a man of broad views and keen foresight, and realized the future which was in store for the
liberal young institution. The major part of his estate was
divided among Amherst College, Williams College, Tufts
College, and the Boston Museum of Natural History.  The
first large sum which the college received after the accession
of Dr. Miner was a gift from his own parish amounting to
between sixteen and seventeen thousand dollars. About this
time the recently redeemed lands of the Back Bay were
placed on the market, and the State decided to appropriate a
considerable portion of the proceeds to educational purposes
<pb n="40" id="p.40"/>
Fifty thousand dollars were offered to Tufts on the condition
that an equal amount should be raised by friends of the
college. Men were soon found to promise the required sum,
and thus $100,000 was secured.</p>
<p> Up to this time there had been a serious lack of secondary
schools offering preparation for Tufts, Westbrook Seminary
affording almost the only adequate facilities; but during
this period the founding of Dean Academy at Franklin,
Massachusetts, and of Goddard Seminary at Barre, Vermont,
both largely owing to the influence of Dr. Miner, furnished
ample opportunity for preparatory training.</p>
<p> As a further condition of the gift of &#x0024;50,000 by the State
in 1863, it was required that three State Scholarships of fifty
dollars each should be established. These were increased to
one hundred dollars each in 1869, at which time the college
tuition fee was raised from thirty-five dollars to sixty. During the same year a gift of one thousand dollars was made,
the income of which was to be used as a loan fund for deserving students, and from this time the number of scholarships
steadily increased. In 1865 four scholarships of fifty dollars
each were set apart from a bequest of $10,000 from Edwin
Howland, and five Walker Mathematical Scholarships of one
hundred dollars each were also established in honor of Dr.
Walker. In 1866 three scholarships of sixty dollars each
were established, - the Perkins Scholarship, founded by
James D. Perkins, of Boston; the Lillie Scholarship, founded
by Henry A. Lillie, of Boston; and another established by
converting the loan fund to that purpose. Two Natural
History Scholarships, one of fifty and the other of one
hundred dollars, were also founded, and were assigned to
members of the Senior Class attaining superior rank in
some branch of Natural History. In 1868 ten Packard Free
Scholarships were established, admitting ten needy students
to the college without the payment of tuition fees. Three
more prize scholarships were offered in Natural History
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00543" id="f5"><head>East Hall</head></figure>
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00091.00002" id="f6"><head>West Hall</head></figure>
<pb n="41" id="p.41"/>
in 1870, and in 1874 four gratuities were made available.
Additional opportunities for a few students to aid themselves were offered by the annual appointment of a chapel
monitor at a salary of twenty dollars, and a bell-ringer, who
received a salary proportional to the number of students, one
dollar being assessed on the term bill of each student.</p>
<p> The Russell Lectureship was established in 1867, in
accordance with a bequest of the Hon. James Russell, of
Arlington, Massachusetts. This bequest provided for an
annual lecture, to be delivered before the Faculty and
students some time during the month of September. Two
subjects, to be used in alternation, were prescribed by Mr.
Russell, "The Importance of Christian Faith and Belief in
the Formation of the Character of the Good Citizen and the
Good Man;" and "The Sufficiency of the Promises of the
Gospel to meet the Reasonable Wants of Man, both in Time
and Eternity." The Russell Lecture is now regularly delivered on the first Sunday after the commencement of the
Fall term, and really constitutes the formal opening of the
college year.  During the years since its establishment
the subjects assigned have been treated by many eminent
men who have given to them their best thought and most
careful preparation.</p>
<p> But one building was erected during Dr. Miner's administration, - West Hall, a four-storied brick dormitory, which
was completed in 1872. This is an attractive building both
inside and outside, and though not the newest it is still the
most popular dormitory on the Hill.</p>
<p> As the resources of the college increased, several additions
were made to the teaching force, and the curriculum was
expanded by the establishment of a Philosophical Course and
a Department of Engineering. In 1861, while the affairs
of the college were in the hands of Professor Marshall,
Benjamin G. Brown, a graduate of Harvard, was engaged as
Tutor in Mathematics, and four years later he was given
<pb n="42" id="p.42"/>
charge of the department with the title of Walker Professor
of Mathematics. In 1862 the Walker Special Instructorship
in Mathematics was established, the appointment thereto
being for a term of three years. Mr. Brown was the first
incumbent, and on becoming a professor was succeeded by
Benjamin F. Kinsman, of the Class of '68. In 1864 Heman
A. Dearborn, A. M., of the Class of '57, was called to the
chair of Latin, made vacant by the death of Professor Keen.
In the same year Professor Tweed resigned his position,
and William R. Shipman, A. M., a graduate of Middlebury
College, was called to take charge of the departments of
Rhetoric, Logic, and English Literature. At this time the
work in Rhetoric still included Oratory, but in 1866 a
special chair of Oratory was established, with Moses True
Brown, A. M., as its incumbent. An instructorship in Vocal
Music was established in 1869. From 1865 until 1872 a
course of lectures on History was offered by the well-known
historical writer, Richard Frothingham, A. M. Charles E.
Fay, of the Class of '68, was appointed Walker Special
instructor upon his graduation, but in the following year he
was transferred to the department of Modern Languages, and
in 1871 assumed entire charge of the work with the title of
Wade Professor of Modern Languages. S. Minot Pitman,
M. E., who had graduated from Tufts in 1869, and spent five
years in study at Harvard and in Germany, was appointed
Walker Special Instructor in 1874, and also served as
Assistant in Chemistry, of which he subsequently became
Professor. In the same year Amos E. Dolbear, A. M., M. E.,
who had already become prominent in the scientific world,
was appointed Professor of Physics and Astronomy.</p>
<p> With the corps of instructors thus augmented, the scope
of the regular curriculum was of course considerably
extended. Facilities for work in Science and the Modern
Languages were especially increased, and a few more <pb n="43" id="p.43"/>electives

were offered. The feeling that there were many young
men whom the requirement of preparation in the Classics
would debar from admission to the regular course led to
the establishment, in 1863, of a Philosophical Course. As
originally planned this course extended over three years, the
required work comprising French and German, Mathematics,
Chemistry, Physics, Botany, Mineralogy, Z&#x00F6;ology, and
Astronomy, Rhetoric and Logic, History and Political
Economy, Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, and Revealed
Religion, while opportunities were offered for elective work
in Civil Engineering and Practical Chemistry. The degree
conferred upon the completion of this course was that of
Bachelor of Philosophy. The requirements for admission
included Mathematics, Geography, History, and English
Grammar. In 1866 Geometry and Algebra were added to
these requirements for admission, and the course was shortened to two years, being given more of a purely scientific
character.</p>
<p> A course in Engineering,leading to the degree of Civil
Engineer, was established in 1865. During the year 1868-69,
T. Willis Pratt, C. E., served as Instructor in Civil Engineering, being assisted by Mr. Kinsman as Instructor in
Applied Mathematics, and in 1869 Charles D. Bray, C. E.,
was appointed Instructor in Civil and Mechanical Engineering, being advanced to the grade of Professor the year
following. This course originally extended over three years,
the requirements for admission being the same as those
of the Philosophical Course. Mathematics, the Physical
Sciences, French, Rhetoric, Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, Political Economy, and Logic were included in the
requirements of the course, while lectures on Mercantile
Usages and on Christian Evidences were introduced in the
third year. It was not long, however, before this course
was placed upon a thoroughly technical basis. In 1874 it

<pb n="44" id="p.44"/>
included  Surveying, Drafting, Construction, Mechanics,
Field Engineering, and Practical Chemistry.</p>
<p> In 1869 another department was added to the college by
the establishment of the Divinity School, the history of
which is detailed in another chapter.</p>
<p> For many years the degree of Master of Arts was conferred
upon all Bachelors of Arts who had been engaged in literary
work for three years, provided that they were of an unexceptionable character, and chose to apply for the degree at least
one week before Commencement. All requirements, however, were gradually raised as the college grew.</p>
<p> The first prizes to be offered at Tufts were derived from
the Goddard Prize Fund, established in 1862. One prize
was offered for the best dissertation by a Senior; one for the
best Greek Prose composition by a Junior; one for the best
examination in Mathematics by a Sophomore; and one for
the best Latin Prose translation by a Freshman. These
prizes were originally in the form of books, as were also
three others added from the same fund in 1866, - one of
twenty-five dollars to the best reader of the Senior Class;
one of twenty dollars to the Junior showing the greatest
improvement in Oratory, and one of fifteen dollars to the
best reader of the Sophomore Class. In 1868, in accordance
with the will of Sylvanus Packard, ten prizes of twenty
dollars each were offered to the ten students ranking highest
in scholarship and good behavior. That year an extra prize
was also offered by Professor Orello Cone, of the Canton
Theological School, - a complete set of Schiller's works for
the best examination in German. In 1869 the prizes offered
in 1866 for reading were made equal, - twenty dollars each,
and in 1874 second prizes of ten dollars each were also
offered. In 1870 a prize of fifteen dollars was offered for
the best examination in Mathematics by a Freshman, the
Latin Prose prize taking the place of the Sophomore prize in
Mathematics.</p>
<pb n="45" id="p.45"/>
<p> In 1872 the Junior Exhibition was abolished at the request
of the Class of 1873, and a year later the Faculty mercifully
discontinued the "Junior Grinds," thus permitting peaceful
forgetfulness of all Freshman and Sophomore subjects prior
to the Senior year.</p>
<p> At the end of Dr. Miner's administration the library had
grown until it contained about fourteen thousand volumes
and more than five thousand pamphlets. The income of a
fund of twelve hundred dollars, established by John D. W.
Joy, of Boston, became available in 1874, and was devoted
to the purchase of books, preference being given to the
department of Philology.</p>
<p> The number of students increased with the facilities of the
college, until in the year 1874 there were eighty-three in
attendance, forty-seven of them being in the regular Course
of Liberal Arts. During the first years of Dr. Miner's presidency, as in the days of Dr. Ballou, the college was loco
parentis to the students, and their comings and goings
were minutely watched. Gradually, however, the stringency
of rules and regulations was relaxed, and the policy of the
Faculty became less restrictive, although it was not until
the following administration that the students were completely placed upon their honor. The college limits were
before long enlarged to include Somerville as well as
Medford, but as the boundary rules were much oftener
"honored in the breach than the observance," all arbitrary
lines were abolished in 1867. Although the young men were
closely watched and frequently corrected, there was no lack
of jolly good times, and many lively pranks prevented life
on the Hill from becoming dull. One method of manifesting
a sportive disposition was the issuing of mock programs at
the time of the Junior Exhibition. Probably this custom
has had its rage in almost every educational institution, and
it generally passes the stage of simple ludicrousness. Some
of the Tufts programs, which were generally distributed on
<pb n="46" id="p.46"/>

the trains which brought guests from Boston to the Hill, are
said to have been positively scurrilous. An occasion which
the boys are said to have greatly enjoyed was the removal of
an unsightly rail fence, which enclosed the entire campus
and extended over other parts of the Hill. The students
having obtained permission to take the fence down, it
vanished in less than an hour and a half. During the first
years of Dr. Miner's administration was continued the
very proper custom of requiring from each student the
deposit of a bond of two hundred dollars; but like many
other rules this soon fell into disuse, the requirement not
being revived until 1895.</p>
<p> During this period student organizations multiplied rapidly. The Mathetican was very active, and in 1871 it found a
running mate in the Zetagathean, which was a society of the
same character organized in the Divinity School. Public
exercises were held under the auspices of both these organizations, which performed a splendid work in the training of
men for public speaking. Mock-trials, furnished annually
by them, provided much amusement. In 1864 the Order of
the Round Table was established as a rival to the Order of
the Coffee Pot. Its motto was Utilitas pariterque Delectatio,
and its badge was an octagonal silver plate very similar to
that of the Coffee Pot.  Both these orders were very active
for a time, but the interest in them died out with the
Commencement season of 1867, and in 1868 they ceased to
have any actual existence. Another local secret society, the
So Fa, was organized in 1869, and existed for a short time.
Zeta Psi and Theta Delta Chi were rapidly coming to assume
the position of leadership, which they subsequently maintained almost without a break for many years.</p>
<p> As the boarding-house had begun to cause considerable
trouble, the students finally took the matter in hand; and in
1870 the Adams Club was formed, furnishing good board at
a reasonable price. John Coleman Adams was the leading
<pb n="47" id="p.47"/>
spirit in this movement, although Dr. Miner and Professor
Shipman had an oversight of the affairs of the club. In
1872 another economic organization was formed, known as
the Tufts Laundry Association.</p>
<p> A Glee Club was formed as early as 1866, and if this one
died out, another was certainly organized in 1874. Several
other musical clubs flourished for short periods. A number
of minor organizations were instituted during this time,
among them the Tufts Chess Club, founded in 1873, and the
Tufts Amateur Dispatch Company, formed for practice in
telegraphy. A Reading-room Association existed, and was
very strong considering the number of students. It supplied the college with many of the leading periodicals.</p>
<p> Athletics were fast becoming a prominent feature of college life. Base-ball was introduced in 1863, and foot-ball
followed ten years later. Many graduates of this period are
inclined to condemn our present athletic system in toto,
but on examination one finds that it is the manner and not
the matter of which they complain. When one says, "There
is a great deal more of athletics in the college course now
than formerly," he should not be set down as an old fogy,
for the remark is explained by what follows: "Then we boys
used to go out, all of us, and take a hand at the bat or football, and come in refreshed and invigorated. . . . Now to
win is the great object at any cost. " It was this universality
of athletics in the life of the students, not the absence of athletics, - this exercise for the love of it, taken in connection
with steady work in other fields for their Alma Mater, that
produced the players who, in the first years of President
Capen's administration, defeated everything in sight. A
fencing club, known as the Order of the Foil and Mask, was
active in cultivating the graceful art of swordsmanship
during this period. Professor Tousey and Professor Bray
were honorary members. Two boat clubs were also organized.
In the Spring of 1865 a four-oared lapstreak working boat
<pb n="48" id="p.48"/>
was purchased by members of the Theta Delta Chi Fraternity,
and placed upon the Mystic River. A boat-house was provided about half a mile from the Medford Bridge. There
was no regular crew, about ten students being interested in
the boat, of which Virgil G. Curtis, '66, was coxswain.
Shortly after the purchase of this boat some students belonging to Zeta Psi purchased a boat also, and erected a boathouse a short distance below the bridge. Occasional friendly
contests took place between the two crafts, but no formal
races were held. The width of the river, indeed, permitted
racing only in the English fashion of the rear boat bumping
the one before it. A college crew was nominally organized,
but it was difficult to maintain an interest in aquatics owing
to the distance of the boat-houses from the college, and in
1866 both boats were sold.</p>
<p> The original Tufts Athletic Association was founded in
November, 1874, and the first athletic contests ever attempted
at the Hill were held on the fourth of the same month. The
events comprised a mile walk, a mile run, a 100-yards dash,
a wheelbarrow race, high and broad jumping, a sack race,
and a three-legged race. The first three events were held
on the reservoir, with prizes of "a fine cane, two elegant
silver cups, and two silver vases." The other contests were
held on the ball ground, south of the reservoir, and must
have greatly resembled a Scotch Picnic.</p>
<p> Previous to 1864 no college publications were issued, but
in that year the first number of the "Tuftonian" appeared.
This was originally an annual of four pages, and the first
issue contained lists of the college organizations, a short
salutatory, and brief articles on "Professor Tweed," and
"Land and Water Sports. " It was published jointly by Theta
Delta Chi and Zeta Psi, and appeared without essential
difference of form until 1867, when it came out in a tinted
cover with a cut of Ballou Hall. It appeared in this form
irregularly until 1872. Its price was ten cents. Prior to
<pb n="49" id="p.49"/>
the issue of this sheet a written paper had been read at stated
times before the Mathetican Society. On acount of a failure
to agree on the part of the two fraternities, the "Tuftonian,"
enlarged to thirty-two pages, was published by Zeta Psi
alone from 1872 to 1877, while Theta Delta Chi issued an
annual of its own, of forty-eight pages, entitled the " Budget."
Considerable literary effort was expended upon these annuals,
and the "grinds " were comparatively few and harmless. In
1874 was formed the Tufts College Publishing Association,
and in June of that year the first number of the "Tufts
Collegian" appeared. This paper at first consisted of eight
pages, then of twelve, and later of sixteen. It was published
monthly at the price of one dollar a year. It was in every
respect a high grade paper from the first, although it has
been said that too many of its best articles were contributed
by the Faculty and by prominent friends of the college. It
continued under the name of the "Collegian " for four years,
when it was rechristened by the name originally chosen for
the college annual.</p>
<p> Mention has been made of the reservoir in connection with
the holding of athletic contests. This was one of the steps
toward improving the land about the college which followed
each other rapidly during these years. During the entire
period of Dr. Ballou's presidency there had been no regular
roadway to the college. College Avenue, leading from
Stearns Avenue in Medford to Broadway in Somerville, was
built during the years 1861-62. For some years previous
to this there had been a foot-bridge, near the site of the
present bridge, for driving cattle across the railroad tracks,
and thence a plank walk ran to Stearns Avenue. An old
cart path had run through the Tufts farm, passing the spot
where the President's house now stands, and turning up by
Professor Marshall's house to the top of the hill.  Over this
were hauled the materials for the first college buildings.
After the completion of College Avenue, Professors Row
<pb n="50" id="p.50"/>
was laid out as far as Packard Avenue, the last-named street
being opened by the improvement of the land about the
reservoir in 1866. The reservoir itself is a part of the
Boston water supply system, and was built by the united
action of Somerville, Charlestown, and Chelsea. Some
grading had been done prior to the building of the reservoir,
but the completion of the streets around it required still
more, principally near West Hall; and about 1869-70 some
further grading was done between the present sites of the
chapel and Miner Hall; so that, taking all the work together,
a large portion of the Hill has been lowered from three to
four feet. A large number of trees had been planted before
this time, and when the grading was done these had to be
lowered with the land. Many of the trees on the southern
lawn were planted by the earlier classes.</p>
<p> On December 3, 1874, at the end of the first half of the
college year, 1874-75, Dr. Miner resigned the presidency.
He felt that he must give up either the college or his parish.
His preferences lay with the latter, and believing that the
work for which he had assumed the presidency was accomplished, he laid it down, and devoted the remainder of his
long and useful life to his labors in the city. To the day of
his death, however, he was an active member of the executive
committee of the Trustees, and he never lost his interest in
the young institution which he had helped to place in a
position of strength and power.</p>
<p> The services of Dr. Miner to Tufts College can be set forth
in no better way than by quoting a "minute" prepared by
the committee to whom his resignation was referred.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="MINUTE" id="c3s3s2">
<head>MINUTE.</head>

<p> "In receiving this day a communication from Rev. Alonzo A.
Miner, D. D., resigning the office of President of the College, we
would unanimously express and place on record our ackowledgment of the zeal, ability, and faithfulness with which he has
<pb n="51" id="p.51"/>

served the corporation. From the moment the movement was
made to establish a college under the auspices of the Universalist
Church, the institution has had in him a steadfast, devoted, and
efficient friend. We think it may be affirmed with truth, without
disparagement of any who may be reckoned among the patrons
and founders of Tufts College, that no one has contributed in so
many different ways to its growth and prosperity. He was one
of the very first to declare its needs and present its claims to the
public.</p>
<p> "The College has had many generous and noble benefactors,
yet perhaps no one has done more than he to give it financial
foundation and success. Mainly through his instrumentality
some of its amplest endowments have been secured. Not alone
from his pulpit and in familiar intercourse with his parishioners,
but in broader fields, where his reputation for prudence and business sagacity have commanded a respectful hearing, he has again
and again called the attention of those who value sound learning
and Christian culture, to the wants of our College, with an emphasis that has brought golden gifts to its treasury.</p>
<p> "Nor has he been less mindful of its chartered rights and legal
privileges than of its financial interests. He has pleaded its
cause before legislative committees with a dignity and logical
force that have secured for it all the immunities of an institution
whose plan is as universal as human learning. He was even the
moving cause that enrolled the State among its patrons.</p>
<p>  "By his extensive fame and commanding talents, moreover, he
has done not a little to obtain for the College the widest public
recognition, and to give it an honorable place among other and
older institutions of a similar class.</p>
<p>  "Upwards of thirteen years ago the office of President of the
College became vacant by the death of the late Hosea Ballou, 2d,
D.D. Yielding to the solicitations of this Board, Dr. Miner laid the
corporation under a new obligation by consenting to fill the vacant
chair.  During the entire period that has intervened, at great
personal inconvenience and sacrifice,--for three years without
pecuniary compensation, -he has discharged the duties of the
office with honor to himself and to the satisfaction and pride of
<pb n="52" id="p.52"/>
nearly every friend of the institution. Under his administration
the College has advanced from comparative weakness to more
than ordinary strength. The sphere of its usefulness has been
greatly extended, and a large measure of freshness and vigor has
been infused into all the departments of its work. Not only have
its own members felt the stimulus of his powerful intellect, but
the members of other institutions have been taught to regard with
unwonted admiration the young College which could boast a head
so illustrious.</p>
<p> "While, therefore, with unfeigned reluctance, we accept the
resignation which he has tendered this day, and which we would
have averted, if possible, we deem it but just to record our thanks
for these and other services which he has rendered to the work
with which this Board is intrusted."</p>

<head>CHAPTER FOURTH:  PRESIDENT CAPEN'S ADMINISTRATION</head>
<pb n="53" id="p.53"/>

<p>IN choosing a successor to Dr. Miner the first name to be
considered was that of another veteran member of the
Board of Trustees, the Hon. Israel Washburn, Jr., Ex-Governor of Maine.   Although the committee appointed to
confer with him received but little encouragement, he was
elected to the office; but he declined it at once. Upon further
consideration, the committee to which the matter was referred, decided that it would be for the best interests of the
college to place one of its own graduates at its head; and on
March 13, 1875, the Rev. Elmer Hewitt Capen, of the class of
1860, who was deeply interested in educational matters, and
was at that time in charge of a prominent parish, was nominated for the presidency. His election was precipitated by a
petition from the Faculty of the college, asking that he be
called; and on June 2, 1875, his inauguration took place.</p>

<p> During the administration of President Capen the growth
of the college has been wonderfully rapid, both upon material
and intellectual lines. Under Dr. Ballou, in spite of financial
deficiencies and the lack of facilities for work, a place was
made in the world of letters for the young institution; under
Dr. Miner this place was made secure by a substantial material support; under Dr. Capen PROGRESS has been the watchword of the college, and the scope of its work has been
broadened and deepened, and the circle of its influence constantly widened, until it holds to-day a place in the front
rank of educational institutions.</p>
<pb n="54" id="p.54"/>
<p> Soon after the accession of President Capen indications of
an increasing spirit of liberality began to appear in the government of the college, one of the most marked being an
increasing elasticity of the curriculum. The policy of raising
the standard of all requirements and broadening the opportunities for elective work at once began. Thirty-two term-hours <note place="foot" n="1">One term-hour = one recitation a week for one term, or its equivalent.</note>
was the amount of work required annually of each student,
except in the Senior year, when but thirty hours were required. In the year 1877-78 the Juniors were allowed to
elect four term-hours, and the Seniors seven; while in 1890-
91, the Sophomores were allowed to elect three, the Juniors
twelve, and the Seniors fifteen. The required work in Latin,
Greek, and Mathematics, which had extended over two years,
was soon confined to one year and a half. In 1875 the Philosophical Course was extended to cover four years, the
requirements for admission being the same as those of the
regular course with the substitution of French for Greek. In
1890 elementary French or German was made requisite for
admission to the regular course, and in 1891 a so-called
Modern Language Course was established, leading to the
degree of A. B., and requiring for admission the presentation
of advanced work in French, with elementary preparation in
German, or vice versa. An intermediate preparation in the
Modern Languages was required for the Philosophical Course,
which now practically coincided with the A. B. course except
in its more elastic requirements for admission. The standard
of work in the Engineering Department also has been raised
steadily: in 1882 a course in Electrical Engineering was
offered, and one in Mechanical Engineering in 1894. In 1892
the courses were extended to cover four years.</p>
<p> Naturally, so many progressive changes could not be made
without necessitating numerous additions to the teaching
force; and the membership of the Faculty of Letters has been
more than doubled, having increased from eleven in 1874 to


<pb n="55" id="p.55"/>
twenty-six in 1895. The strengthening of the department of
Science began with the appointment of Professor Dolbear in
1874. In 1877, on the expiration of his term as Walker
Special Instructor, Mr. Pitman was appointed Professor of
Chemistry, thus leaving Professor Marshall free to devote
his entire time to Mineralogy, Geology, and Natural History.
Professor Pitman was absent from the college during the
year 1881-82, and resigned his position at the beginning of
the next year. During his absence the noted chemist, Arthur
Michael, A. M. (later Ph. D.), had directed the work of the
department, and upon Professor Pitman's resignation he was
appointed to fill the vacancy. A wealthy man as well as an
ardent scientist, he personally employed a number of instructors and assistants, and the laboratory at Tufts became well
known as a seat of research. Professor Michael resigned his
position in 1889, and Arthur M. Comey, Ph. D., who had
served as assistant under Professor Michael in 1882-83, was
called to the chair. Professor Comey served until 1893, when
he resigned, and during the next year Frank W. Durkee,
A. M., of the class of '88, who had been appointed Instructor
in 1889, served as Acting Professor. In the following year
Dr. Michael returned to Tufts, where lie now directs the work
of the graduate department, Mr. Durkee having charge of
the undergraduate work with the title of Assistant Professor.
John E. Bucher, Ph. D., was appointed Instructor in Organic Chemistry in 1894, and Howard H. Higbee, Ph. D.,
Instructor in Quantitative Analysis in 1895. During the
year 1894-95, T. H. Clark, Ph. D., served in the latter
capacity. Several assistants are also employed. As a further
step in the development of the scientific department, a chair
of Biology was established in 1892, and filled by an enthusiast in his work, J. Sterling Kingsley, S. D., a graduate of
Williams College. Under his direction this department has
grown rapidly. The Natural History scholarships have been
converted into two fellowships of two hundred and fifty dollars
<pb n="56" id="p.56"/>
each, and are now held by two graduate students. One A.
M. and one Ph. D. have already been granted in Biology.</p>
<p> Two other new departments have been established, - that
of History in 1892; and that of Music in 1895. The former is
in charge of Edwin A. Start, A. M., a graduate of the class of
'84, who brought to his work, besides the preparation of a
scholar, the experience of several years in journalism and
political affairs. He has been obliged to create the department, but has done so very successfully, and now offers a comprehensive list of courses. In 1877 the instructorship in
Vocal Music was discontinued, and no further work was done
in that line until 1895, when a chair of the History and
Theory of Music was created, with Leo R. Lewis, A. M., a
graduate of the class of '87, as its incumbent. Mr. Lewis had
been appointed Instructor in French in 1892, and he is still
giving some courses in that language although devoting his
principal energies to his special department. He has secured
the gift of an exceptionally fine musical library; and his
thorough knowledge of his subject and his ability as a teacher
foreshadow success.</p>
<p> In the departments of Mathematics and Engineering a
number of appointments have been made. In 1883 William
L. Hooper, A. M., a graduate of the class of '77, was appointed
Assistant Professor of Physics, and in 1890 he was made
Professor of Electrical Engineering. He is an expert in
electricity, and under his care the department of Electrical
Engineering has become known among practical electricians
for the thorough quality of its work. In 1893 Gardner C.
Anthony, A. M., was appointed Professor of Technical Drawing, and also Dean of the newly established Bromfield-Pearson
School. Frank E. Sanborn, a graduate of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, was appointed Walker Special Instructor in 1891, and on the expiration of his term of three
years was made Instructor in Mechanical Engineering. Also
in 1891, Frank T. Daniels, A. M. B., of the class of 1890,

<pb n="57" id="p.57"/>
was appointed Assistant in Drawing and Surveying, and in
the following year he became Instructor in Civil Engineering. In 1893 Horatio W. Myrick, A. M. B., also of the Class
of '90, was appointed Instructor in Electrical Engineering,
and the next year he was appointed to the Walker Instructorship also. He resigned both positions in 1896, -Frank G.
Wren, '94, already an Instructor in Mathematics, being
appointed to fill the latter. Practical working in wood and
metal has been made a feature of the Engineering department.
James M. Merrill served as Instructor in Carpentry in 1889-90,
S. Thomas Kirk in 1890-91; and in 1893 George H. Furbish
was engaged as a teacher and placed in charge of the shops
in the Bromfield-Pearson School.</p>
<p> In 1891 the classical department received a valuable addition in Frank P. Graves, Ph. D., a graduate of Columbia
University, who came to the Hill as Instructor in Greek and
now holds the title of Professor of Classical Philology. In the
same year David L. Maulsby, A. M., of the Class of '87 was
appointed Professor of English Literature and Oratory. Professor M. T. Brown at this time went to reside in Ohio, and
was made Emeritus. The appointment of Professor Maulsby
removed one burden from the broad shoulders of Professor
Shipman, who, having charge of the entire department of
English together with Logic and Psychology, had perpetuated
to an unnecessary extent the program of self-sacrificing hard
labor of the earlier members of the Faculty.  A further
division of his work was accomplished in 1894 by the
appointment of Thomas Whittemore, '94, as Instructor in
English.  Charles St. C. Wade, A. M., '94, was appointed
Instructor in French in the same year; and a number of
recent graduates of the college, and others, are at present
serving as assistants in the departments of Modern Languages,
Philosophy, and Engineering.</p>
<p> In 1893 a great change was made in the curriculum,-- a
change which has given Tufts College a new prominence and

<pb n="58" id="p.58"/>
made it a leader in the march of educational progress. The
expansion of the Philosophical Course, and the establishment
of the so-called Modern Language Course, had both been
steps in one direction, - namely, the conforming of the
college requirements to the preparatory training of English
High Schools and such other preparatory institutions as
furnished other than a strictly " Classical" course. These
new courses offered by the college were merely compromises,
and for several succeeding years President Capen, in his
annual reports, expressed the hope that some more satisfactory
arrangement would soon be made. At length, during the
year 1892-93, Edwin A. Start, then serving his first year as
a member of the Faculty, secured the appointment of a committee to consider a plan whereby the entire curriculum of
the college should be remodelled, the object being to render
it more elastic, and at the same time more productive of
genuine scholarship than before. The committee consisted
of President Capen, Professors Shipman, Comey, and Graves,
and Mr. Start. A report, drawn up by Mr. Start, was presented to the Faculty by the committee, and was adopted after
considerable discussion.  Circular announcements were at
once sent out, and the new system went into effect with the
opening of the Fall term of 1893.</p>
<p> Under this plan, the requirement for the Bachelor's degree
is the satisfactory completion of one hundred and twenty-
eight term-hours of college work, the factor of a certain term
of residence being eliminated. Any student capable of completing this amount of work, with the attainment of a high
average, in three years, may receive the degree at the end
of that time. One man has already done so, while another
has attained to the Master's degree at the end of four years.
Of this hundred and twenty-eight term-hours, fifty are occupied with prescribed work, but in all departments except
English and Mathematics the requirements are by groups,
not by subjects, thus allowing some choice.</p>

<pb n="59" id="p.59"/>

a reasonable amount of Physical Training, is as follows:-</p>

<p> A large portion of the prescribed work can be completed
in the Freshman year, and at the beginning of the Sophomore
year each student chooses a major subject, in which he must
complete work amounting to eighteen term-hours.    The
student's major instructor becomes his official adviser in
matters relating to his college course, and under his advice,
the student chooses eighteen more term-hours of work in
subjects which will aid him in his major study. The balance
of his work--forty-two term-hours--he is at liberty to
elect as he pleases, subject only to the arrangement of the
college program. Nearly all the courses in the curriculum
have been arranged for three recitations per week; and by a
careful grouping of subjects on alternate days, there occur
but few cases of a student being altogether debarred from
taking any course on account of conflict in the program.</p>
<p> The advantages of this plan of arrangement are manifold
and self-evident. To quote the circular which announced it
to the world, it was adopted "in the belief that the true
ground for promotion is intellectual attainment, and that the
fixed requirement of a certain number of years of study,

<pb n="60" id="p.60"/>
without regard to the mental power and achievements of the
individual student, does not tend to encourage the highest
scholarship." To quote still further: " It will be seen that
this plan is at once liberal, controlled, and elastic. Through-
out his course the student will have large liberty in choosing
his work, but a considerable portion of that work will be
arranged for him and directed by men who can judge of his
requirements better than he can himself.  A reasonable
amount of guided specialization is provided for, and each
student will be brought into personal relations with his
major instructor, in a way that can hardly fail to produce
good results in his college work." The expectations set forth
in the above quotations have been fully realized. A change
has been wrought in the intellectual life of the students.
They no longer drag through the prescribed studies because
they are prescribed, electing "snaps" whenever the oppor-
tunity offers. Working for honors in a major subject means
just so much preparation for a chosen profession, and the
result is that while each student receives the benefit of a
broad and liberal education, he accomplishes in some special
line results really worthy of a scholar.  The system has
now been in operation nearly three years, and during this
time has shown itself to be a step in the right direction of
which Tufts College may well be proud. With a more logical
system of entrance requirements to round out and complete
it, it will leave little to be desired.</p>
<p> The material development of the college has kept pace
with the intellectual. The library has grown rapidly. By
the year 1886 it could no longer be accommodated in Ballou
Hall, and a stack was built at the rear of Middle Hall, which
is now the library building, although still accommodating a
few students. Professor Keen had served as librarian during his life, and Professor Shipman, who succeeded him,
occupied the position until 1884, when Miss Helen L. Mellen,
who had for some time performed the active duties of the
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00091.00003" id="f8"><head>Barnum Museum</head></figure>
<pb n="61" id="p.61"/>

office, was placed in charge. Among the principal gifts to
the library are an alcove of books from Miss Mary E. Bacon,
and about twenty-five hundred volumes from the late Thomas
Whittemore, D. D. In 1880 friends of the college procured
for it a considerable portion of the library of the late Dr.
Chapin. The Joy Library Fund was increased to twenty
thousand dollars in 1886, and soon after the library of the
late W. H. Ryder, D. D., was given by Mrs. Ryder. The
most recent additions to the library are the fine historical
collection of the late Richard Frothingham, A. M., and the
musical collection already mentioned.</p>
<p> Many buildings have been erected during this period.
Goddard Chapel was dedicated on March 29, 1882. It was
given by Mrs. Mary T. Goddard in memory of her husband,
Thomas A. Goddard; and its tall campanile rises as a beautiful monument to the most modest, but one of the most large
hearted benefactors of the college.  The architect of the
chapel is J. Philip Rinn, of Boston, and the edifice has been
described by competent judges as one of the ten finest pieces
of architecture in New England. The gymnasium, also a gift
from Mrs. Goddard, was completed in 1884. Although its
arrangements leave something to be desired, it has served the
purposes of the college well until lately; the present body of
students calls for a larger building. From 1885 to 1889,
with the exception of the year 1886-87, Fremont Swain, M. D.,
was engaged as Gymnasium Director. In 1889 Mr. Durkee
assumed this position, retaining it until 1895, when Charles
C. Stroud '94 was engaged. W. R. Woodbury, M. D., of the
class of '85, is now serving as Medical Examiner. He is also
a lecturer in the Medical School, the establishment of which
is chronicled in another chapter.</p>
<p> In 1882 the Barnum Museum, the gift of the great showman whose name it bears, was begun. Mr. Barnum gave
$55,000 for the original building, and by his will left $40,000
more for the addition of two wings, one of which has already

<pb n="62" id="p.62"/>
been built. The museum is an imposing structure of gray
slate stone, and contains, in addition to large exhibition halls,
roomy and well-lighted lecture rooms and laboratories for
elementary, advanced, and graduate work in Biology, Mineralogy, and Geology. The new wing, especially, which was
designed under the supervision of Dr. Kingsley, is a model
in its arrangements for work. Mr. Barnum gave a large collection of stuffed animals to the museum, and in the main
hall, calm and majestic as in life, Jumbo still draws around
him a court of admirers. Through the efforts of Professor
Marshall a noteworthy collection of minerals and fossils is
also on exhibition.</p>
<p> Dean Hall, a three-story brick dormitory, erected with
funds left by the late Dr. Oliver Dean, was completed in
1886. It is not beautiful to look at, but its rooms are the
finest on the Hill. The Divinity buildings, Miner Hall and
Paige Hall, will be spoken of in the next chapter.</p>
<p> The Bromfield-Pearson School was established in 1894,
with funds left by the late Henry B. Pearson, and occupies
a commodious brick building between Boston Avenue and
College Avenue. It provides a course of technical instruction
extending through two years, and also serves as a preparatory
school for the Engineering department. Under the charge of
Professor Anthony the school is doing very successful work.
The building affords the best of opportunities for practical
shop-work, and the Engineering students of the college are
given instruction in this line. For a time previous to the
erection of the building they were obliged to go to the
Cambridge Manual Training School and elsewhere for this
purpose.</p>
<p> Three other new buildings were completed in 1894, the
Chemical Laboratory, the Common Building, and Metcalf
Hall, -a dormitory for women. The Chemical Laboratory
is a temporary wooden building, not unlike a shoe-shop in
appearance; but it contains every facility for work, and will
<pb n="63" id="p.63"/>
serve its purpose well until the erection of a new building.
The Commons Building contains the college dining-room, or
"Dive," a general book and supply store, and a post-office,
while the second and third floors are occupied by rooms for
students. Both these buildings are at the foot of the Hill,
near the Bromfield-Pearson School. By the erection of the
Chemical Laboratory and the Bromfield-Pearson building, the
scientific apparatus has been removed from Ballou Hall, with
the exception of that of the Physical department, which occupies the third floor of the building. The rooms formerly
occupied by the department of Chemistry are now fitted up as
lecture rooms with connecting department libraries for the
departments of History and English Literature.</p>
<p> The increase in the number of buildings, and the improvement of the grounds, have made necessary the employment of
a large force of janitors and all-round men, but among these
there are still two faces familiar to graduates of years gone
by. Patrick Byrne, the original farmer and general factotum
of the college, is still in charge of the grounds, and has had
the pleasure of seeing a son graduate in the class of 1894.
Nicholas Dwyer, too, is an old stand-by, whose loyalty to the
college is sincere and aggressive.</p>
<p> The financial contributions to the college have been steady
and substantial.  In 1885 Miss Harriet H. Fay left the
amount necessary to support a professorship of English Literature, and in 1887 came a bequest of $25,000 from Henry B.
Pearson to found a professorship in some branch of Natural
Science, while numerous smaller contributions have been
received. Recently Mrs. Robinson, widow of Charles Robinson, LL.D., late President of the Board of Trustees, and her
son Sumner Robinson, A. M., LL.B., of the Class of '88, have
announced their intention of erecting a costly scientific building; and by the will of the late Mrs. Helen M. Jackson a new
recitation hall and the establishment of a professorship in
Civics are provided. The tuition fee of the college has been

<pb n="64" id="p.64"/>
raised from $60 to $75, and again from $75 to $100; but the
number of scholarships has greatly increased, and the college
has been enabled to grant a large number of gratuities, so
that the present amount of college aid annually available is
about eight thousand dollars.</p>
<p> The increase in the number of students has been rapid.
In 1880 there were seventy-five undergraduates in all departments; in 1890 there were a hundred and forty-five; and at
present there are two hundred and ninety-one excluding the
matriculates in the new Medical School. This growth has
necessitated the appointment of another financial officer to relieve the Treasurer of a portion of his duties, and the Rev. W.
A. Start, A. M., of the Class of '62, was made Bursar in 1895.</p>
<p> The activity of the student body has kept pace with its
numerical growth. The students have been treated as men,
with the result that they have generally deported themselves
as men. Probably there has been a greater variety of "high-
jinks " than ever before, but only a few things have been done
for which the perpetrators need feel seriously ashamed of
themselves. It is perhaps true that, owing to an exaggerated
class-spirit and the decline of a number of traditional customs,
the tone of student life had fallen off at the end of the eighties,
but in the early nineties began a renaissance, which has ended
by making the standard exceptionally high. Hazing, never
a very prominent feature of life at Tufts, received its death-blow in 1882. For several years the Sophomores had been
becoming more and more exacting in their demands on the
Freshmen, and some unusually rough treatment in the Fall
of 1879 had made the class of '83 thoroughly warm. The
class of '84, however, refused to be hazed, and, being a strong
class, established its independence after some hard fighting.
The next year the same class passed anti-hazing resolutions,
and when the upper classes opposed these, the Sophomores
deliberately established themselves as protectors of the Freshmen,
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00091.00004" id="f9"><head>Metcalf Hall</head></figure>
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00091.00005" id="f10"><head>Theta Delta Chi Charge-House</head></figure>
<pb n="65" id="p.65"/>
putting under the pump one of their own number who
refused to be bound by the action of the class. Of course,
hazing of a mild sort continued to exist, and still exists, but
no one is ever hurt, the annual " Freshman Visitation" being
merely a regular part of the college program. There have been
mythical hazing societies which have attempted to organize
the fun and make it more lively, but they never have revived
the ill-natured spirit which disappeared ten years ago. Of
these societies only the names ever existed, and the names
only remain. Kappa Gamma Rho was imagined into existence in 1887, and its successor is Rho Kappa Tau.</p>
<p> The introduction of co-education has made a vast difference in the life of the students. When the college was first
opened nothing was said regarding this matter, as it was intended to place Tufts College on a footing with the other New
England colleges, which were not co-educational. The fathers
of the movement, however, would probably have been glad to
see women admitted on the same terms as men; for when
a communication appeared in the " Trumpet" asking if the
college was to be co-educational, Mr. Whittemore's published
reply was that he saw no reason why it should not be so.
Gradually, as the problem of co-education began to assume
more and more importance in the college world, a number of
the Trustees began to favor the admission of women to
Tufts. President Capen was entirely in sympathy with the
idea, and advocated it on all possible occasions. The Faculty
and Alumni were divided on the subject; but the students
were thoroughly in opposition, and their feeling was so strong
that some members of the Faculty declared that many men
would be kept away if women were admitted. In the Spring
of 1882, however, President Capen publicly expressed his
views; and the matter of raising the requisite extra funds was
taken in hand by the Women's Universalist Missionary Society
of Massachusetts, in 1886.  Mrs. Caroline B. Skinner, of
Somerville, was the most ardent worker in behalf of the <pb n="66" id="p.66"/>movement, but she did not live to see its successful issue. Dying
in that same year, she bequeathed her diamond ring and camel's
hair shawl with the request that they be converted into money
and used to advance the cause in which her interest was
centered. The sum derived from these gifts formed the first
contribution toward enabling Tufts to open its doors to women.
The trustees were reluctant to make the final decision, because
of the lack of any suitable accommodations; but it was thought
that the few young women entering during the first year or
two might find homes near the Hill, and in 1892 the first
women students entered Tufts College. Five matriculated in
the College of Letters, and three in the Divinity School. Of
the former four were entered as Freshmen, while the fifth,
entering as a Senior, attained the distinction of being the first
woman to graduate from Tufts. This was Miss Henrietta
N. Brown, daughter of Professor Brown, and now the wife of
Assistant Professor Durkee.</p>
<p> At first the girls were looked upon as intruders, and '95,
the last bachelor class to graduate, took to itself great credit
for its womanless condition; but now that a large number of
women are in attendance this feeling has died away. Whether
co-education is best or not in the long run, its influence on the
young men is a refining one. In 1894 a beautiful home was
provided for the young women by the erection of Metcalf Hall,
the gift of Albert Metcalf, of Newton. This is a handsome
three-story structure of yellow brick with grey sandstone
trimmings, situated on Professors Row.  It contains a reception room, a library, a dining-room with admirable
kitchen conveniences, and a suite of rooms for a matron, as
well as dormitory accommodations for twenty-four students.
The plans were drawn by the architect of the chapel and
museum, J. Philip Rinn. There being as yet no women on
the Faculty, the Trustees in 1895 appointed a committee of
ladies to serve as an advisory counsel for the girls. The
present members of this committee are Mrs. E. H. Capen,
<pb n="67" id="p.67"/>
Mrs. W. A. Start, Mrs. Albert Metcalf, Mrs. D. L. Maulsby,
and Miss Grace Marvin, M. D. There are now more than
sixty young women in the College of Letters and Divinity
School, besides a large number in the Medical School.</p>
<p> Student organizations have multiplied with great rapidity
during this period. Three more Greek-letter fraternities have
established chapters on the Hill, and three local secret societies have been founded. The Tufts Chapter of Delta Upsilon
was instituted in 1886. It has grown steadily, and now occupies a commodious chapter house on Sawyer Avenue, completed in 1894. The Beta Mu Chapter of Delta Tau Delta
was instituted in 1889, and at once took a high rank in college society. A chapter house was rented in 1892, and a
much more commodious one, on Curtis Street, in 1894. The
Gamma Beta Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega was instituted in
1893. In 1891 a local Hebrew-letter society was established
in the Divinity School, and since 1894 it has occupied a house
of its own on Sawyer Avenue. There are in all four chapter
houses on the Hill, Theta Delta Chi having erected a large
and admirably arranged building at the corner of Packard
and Talbot Avenues in 1893. These houses form a part of
the many building improvements which have taken place on
and about the Hill in the last few years, and they are a credit
to the organizations owning them. In 1895 two local societies were formed among the young women of the college, -
Alpha Kappa Gamma and Alpha Delta Sigma. Both are
still in their infancy, but show every promise of a successful
career.</p>
<p> Naturally the growing power of the fraternities in college
affairs has often been resented by the non-society students,
and in the years from 1884 to 1886 this resentment took an
active form. The non-society students were at that time
strong in numbers, and in 1884 they united with Zeta Psi to
oppose Theta Delta Chi. The next year the aid of Zeta Psi
was disregarded, and for a short time the non-society men
<pb n="68" id="p.68"/>
were in complete ascendancy. The entrance of other fraternities has made a great difference in matters of this sort,
however. The bitterness which had grown up between the
Zetes and the Thetes has passed away; and, although inter-fraternity coalitions are constantly formed for political purposes, the number of organizations prevents any rancorous
factional jealousy.</p>
<p> The complaint has often been made that the fraternities
at Tufts have killed off the general literary societies. This
may be true, for it is a fact that the latter class of organization has had but a precarious existence for a number of years.
The Zetagathean of the Divinity School was short-lived. The
Sawyer Club was formed as a successor to it about 1890, but
this also was not long for this world. The Mathetican existed for many years on the prestige of its name, but more
and more difficulty was found in obtaining a quorum for
its meetings, and, at length, on Jan. 24, 1896, a faithful
few met together and formally disbanded the society. Thus
passed away in the fifty-second year of its age an organization which, in its day, had been as powerful a factor in
the training of men as any portion of the curriculum. The
records of the Mathetican are deposited in the college
library; its funds- for it did not die in poverty -have been
bequeathed to a new association which has just been organized,- the Tufts Debating Union. This society, formed
under the spur of a movement toward intercollegiate debate
among the New England colleges, promises to be active, for a
time at least. It meets weekly, debating subjects of current
interest.</p>
<p> In the musical and dramatic field a constant activity has
been maintained. For a time the Glee Club almost ceased to
exist, but it has developed steadily during the last twelve years,
having taken on a new activity during the years from 1883 to
1887, when Professor Lewis was a student. Since his return
to the Hill his interest in the club has not abated, and he has

<pb n="69" id="p.69"/>
carefully trained it each season. The club has a carefully
arranged constitution, providing for an advisory committee of
the Faculty. For some years it has held an enviable reputation as an entertainment organization, its dates being easily
filled every season. The Mandolin and Guitar Club co-operates with the Glee Club, and is also among the first of its
class. It is the successor of a Banjo Club, which it superseded when the mandolin crowded out the banjo as a fashionable instrument. A college orchestra was maintained for
many years, but died out in the late eighties for lack of interest. At several periods a quartette has been organized by
some of the best singers in College.</p>
<p> The Tufts Dramatic Club was organized in 1876, its leading spirit being J. H. Bradbury, who has since become widely
known as a comedian. Apparently, however, this club did
not live long. In 1886 the Stuft Club was organized; those
principally interested being C. H. Paterson, who was an actor
for some years after graduating, L. R. Lewis, C. K. Bolles,
and E. J. Crandall. It died with the departure from college
of John Burgess Weeks in 1892. Mr. Weeks is now stage
manager for Otis Skinner. In 1894, the class of '95 presented an original comedy entitled "Me an' Otis," the honors
being divided between the author, C. H. Wells, and C. D.
Clark. In 1895, under the direction of Professor Maulsby,-
who, by the way, was also a charter member of the Stuft
Club,--a grand reproduction of Nicholas Udall's comedy,
" Ralph Roister Doister," was given in the Gymnasium. The
leading r&#x00F4;le was played by Mr. Clark, who is now preparing
for the stage in New York. Thus, up to the present time,
every dramatic venture at Tufts has furnished the stage with
an able comedian. The latest dramatic organization to be
formed is the Modjeska Club, the purpose of which is the production of legitimate drama. It came into being in the
Winter of 1895, and Goldsmith's "Good-natured Man" is
announced for production this Spring.</p>

<pb n="70" id="p.70"/>
<p> Among other organizations may be mentioned the Evening
Party Association, which has now been in existence for several
years. Who its founders were is not known. For some time
it had a hard struggle for existence; but hard work on the
part of the managers in 1894-95 resulted in the payment of
its old debts and its establishment on a sound basis. Six or
seven parties are regularly given each year, and since the
advent of the young women they have become almost exclusively college affairs. A branch of the National Young
People's Christian Union was established on the Hill in 1891,
and is doing much good in a quiet way. A Republican Club
and a Prohibition Club were organized in 1892. The latter
is active, the former resuming its existence as occasion requires. The Tufts Chess Club has been maintained most of
the time; and a Bicycle Club, which was formed eight or
nine years ago, was active until recently. Among other
societies which have flourished at one time or another during
the last few years may be mentioned a Sketch Club, a Camera
Club, a Telegraphic Association, a Pedestrian Club, and an
Engineering Fraternity. A graduate association known as the
Tufts College Club flourished for a number of years, reaching
its maximum strength in 1885 and 1886, but it is now
practically extinct. The Tufts College Alumni Association
has existed as a strong organization for many years. Alumni
Day was celebrated at the Hill until 1888; an annual dinner
is now served in Boston.</p>
<p> A number of social customs have been inaugurated during
the past decade. The most important is Class Day, the credit
for permanently establishing which belongs to the Class of
'91. Class Day had been celebrated before, but always as a
strictly Senior affair; and the custom had at length almost
died out. The Class of '91 determined to enlist the sympathy
of all the classes, and to that end made a canvass of the
entire college. The program arranged was of a general
nature. The occasion was a great success; and the succeeding

<pb n="71" id="p.71"/>
classes were ready and eager to take up the custom. It has
been celebrated ever since, with but few departures from the
program offered by '91. The wearing of caps and gowns was
introduced by the Class of '92, the members of which first
wore them on May 8th of that year. About ten years previously Oxford caps with colored tassels had been worn for
a short time by all the classes. The Junior Promenade was
introduced by '91, the first being given on May 29, 1890.
The custom has been followed by all the succeeding classes
except '95 and '96, the former class substituting the play,
"Me an' Otis," already mentioned.</p>
<p> The history of athletics during this period is well worth
study. In the previous chapter anticipatory reference was
made to the successes of the baseball and football teams during
the first years of President Capen's administration.  Both
teams were already strong in 1875, and they soon dealt out
defeat to the representatives of many larger institutions,
including Harvard itself. The make-up of these two teams
is a matter of historical interest, and is therefore given in full.
In 1875 the football team was captained by L. W. Aldrich,
'76; the other regular players being F. B. Harrington, '77;
A. B. Fletcher, '76; P. N. Branch, '77; H. D. Nash, '77;
C. L. Cushman, '78; A. P. French, '76; C. A. Sprague, '76;
H. L. Whithed, '77; W. M. Perry, '78; and L. M. Ballou, '78.
Harrington was captain and catcher of the baseball nine,
and Ballou was pitcher; G. T. Knight, now of the Divinity
Faculty, was 1st base; C. O. Murray, '77, 2d base; S. P.
Record, '77, 3d base; C. R. Tenney, centre field; W. M.
Perry, left field; W. W. Campbell, '78, right field; and D. R.
Brown, '77, short stop.  As has already been said, the
strength of these teams lay to a great extent in the way in
which the entire college took part in athletic sports.  The
system of specializing players which has since come into
vogue in almost all colleges is radically wrong, for it seriously
impairs enthusiasm, which is above all things necessary to

<pb n="72" id="p.72"/>
a winning team. After the period of greatness followed a
period of decline, in football especially, which lasted until
quite recently. A very strong football team was put into
the field in 1892, but there followed a period of weakness
which is just beginning to give place to one of new strength.
The development of baseball during the last few years has
been steady, and in 1895 a remarkably fine nine was placed
in the field. On April 20, 1895, a good " fair and square "
game with Harvard on Holmes Field resulted in a victory
for Tufts with a score of eleven to seven. Much good tennis
playing has been done on the college courts, but for the last
two years the game has not received the official attention it
deserves. This is soon to be remedied, however.</p>
<p> The custom of holding an annual Field Day, which had
been out of use for many years, was re-established by the
Class of 1892. An ineffectual attempt was made to secure
the co-operation of all the classes, and the meet was held by
'92 alone on March 21, 1890.  Although no records were
broken the occasion was a success, and the rest of the college
at once expressed a willingness to take up the matter. Accordingly a Field Day Association was formed, and the first regularly established college Field Day was held on May 31, 1891.
An Indoor Meet in the Gymnasium was established soon after,
and on June 7, 1892, the Class of '91 offered a silver cup, to
be held each year by the class scoring the greatest number of
points at the two Meets. The following table shows the best
records of the college in the various events up to the present
time: -</p>

<p>  A new Athletic Association was organized in September,
1891, with F. W. Perkins as its first President. The old
organization had died out some years before, and the various
branches of athletics, each upheld by those especially interested, were all suffering by reason of conflicting interests.
The constitution of this association provided for an Advisory
Committee consisting of three undergraduates, three alumni,
and three members of the Faculty. The different branches of
athletics were placed in charge of separate committees, over
which the Advisory Committee exercised supervision. The
membership fee was five dollars. In 1893 the athletic records
of the college were investigated by the association, and medals
were offered to those who should better them. In many ways
the existence of the Athletic Association was beneficial, but
its membership was small compared to that of the student
body, and by the year 1895 its finances had sunk to a deplorable condition. It was then that the Trustees, at the desire
of a majority of the students, decided to add six dollars to
the regular gymnasium fee of four dollars, and devote the
money thus raised to the purposes of out-door instruction and

<pb n="74" id="p.74"/>

the improvement of the Tufts Oval, a new athletic field fenced
off in 1894. This action was heartily indorsed by the students
in mass meeting assembled, and since the Athletic Association, by virtue of the fact that its constitution confined the
privilege of voting on athletic affairs to those who had paid
the five dollars fee for the year, was practically killed by being
deprived of its position of financial control, it was formally
dissolved, and a new constitution for the government of
athletics was adopted by the students as a whole. In framing
this constitution many errors which experience had shown in
the old organization have been avoided, but the only material
difference between the two is the enlargement of the number
of members, or electors. Each department of athletics is
now in the hands of a single manager instead of a committee
of three as heretofore, and several other minor changes have
been made.</p>
<p> Altogether the athletic spirit of Tufts is growing broader;
and though it is doubtful if it will ever again have the general
character which it possessed when the college was smaller,
the interest of a much larger share of the students is enlisted
by thus drawing them into the enlarged Athletic Association. Among several good rules which have recently been
adopted by the Advisory Committee is one which excludes all
but students in regular standing from playing on the college
teams.</p>
<p> Last among the various phases of college activity which
have been reviewed in this chapter comes the college Press,
but it by no means ranks at the end of the list in importance.
The Press mirrors the life of the community which it represents; and journalism at Tufts has kept pace with the other
rapidly broadening activities of the institution. In 1878
Zeta Psi and Theta Delta Chi reconciled their differences and
again united in publishing an annual, which consisted of
seventy-two pages, and was christened the " Brown and Blue "
from the college colors. In the same year the " Collegian " was

<pb n="75" id="p.75"/>
re-christened the "Tuftonian," which name, although lacking any philological foundation, has been thus perpetuated.
In 1886 the paper was changed from a monthly to a bi-weekly,
but it was made a monthly again in 1895, the " Tufts Weekly,"
an eight page news sheet, being established under the management of the same staff. This paper satisfies a long felt want,
by giving the news of the college before it is stale, and by
furnishing a medium for the publication of notices and college
documents. The "Tuftonian" and the " Weekly" should
now be placed under separate boards of editors, the former,
by a change in management, being made to fill a place
resembling that of the Harvard Graduates' Magazine. By the
constitution of the Publishing Association the editorial staff
of the papers consists of eleven editors, who are apportioned
among the fraternities and other bodies of students interested
according to the proportion of subscriptions furnished. The
choice of the Editor-in-chief is left to the Faculty, and only
once has it ever been taken from that body. The occasion
was the non-society uprising in 1885, when the controlling
forces refused to submit the appointment, electing C. M.
Ludden, '86, on their own responsibility.</p>
<p> As in other colleges, the publication of an annual has fallen
into the hands of the Junior Class. In 1888 the pamphlet had
reached a considerable size, with numerous illustrations, and
also numerous " grinds." Soon after followed a bound volume of the regular type, familiar to every one conversant
with college life and customs. The " Brown and Blue " was
issued regularly until 1894, when the Junior Class, wishing
to show some degree of originality and offer something of
permanent value, published a collection of "Tufts Songs."
In the preparation of this work, the editors received valuable
aid from Professor Lewis, and the book, which contains a
large number of songs written by Tufts men, is a valuable
contribution from a musical as well as a college point of
view.  The present volume represents another departure

<pb n="76" id="p.76"/>
from the traditional custom. Up to the date of its publication, there have been only a few magazine articles to tell the
history of the college, and only the quinquennial or triennial
catalogues to furnish a record of its alumni. Tufts College
has reached a point in its career when its history is worth
writing,--when the writing of it as it should be written is
already a task beyond the student whose time is largely occupied with other work; but those who have collected the
material for this publication feel that what leisure they could
afford could be spent in no better way than in an attempt at
least to tell the story of their Alma Mater. At some future
day- perhaps when the centennial of the college is celebrated- some one will take up the work and give to it the
time and care which it deserves. Both time and care will
indeed be requisite fifty years from now, for history is being
made almost faster than it can be written, and the story of
"Charlie's Light" will be the story of a lamp which has
burned very brightly and illumined a wide-spreading circle
with its rays.

<head>CHAPTER FIFTH:THE DIVINITY SCHOOL.</head>
<pb n="77" id="p.77"/>

<p>ALTHOUGH the Divinity School was not opened until
      the college had been established some fifteen years,
the movement which led to its existence was a part of the
same agitation in which the college itself had its origin. As
has been previously stated, the Educational Convention of
1847 resolved on the establishment of a theological school,
as well as of a college, recommending that the latter be
located in New York State, and the former in Massachusetts.
When, however, owing to the munificence of Massachusetts
men, Walnut Hill was decided upon as the site of the college, the New York Universalists thought the divinity school
should come to them.   Thus the intention to establish a
college in New York, and a divinity school in Massachusetts
was reversed, and resulted in the founding of Tufts College
and Canton Theological School.</p>
<p> While it was by no means intended to make a divinity
school of Tufts College, it was expected that those young
men who intended to enter the ministry would avail themselves of the opportunities there offered for advanced education.  But Mr. Packard, the largest benefactor of the
college, was strong in his desire that a theological course
should be offered at College Hill, and his will stipulated that
the Trustees should establish and maintain out of the rents
and profits of his estate a professorship of Christian Theology. To this provision was due directly the origin of Tufts
Divinity School. It is not certain that Mr. Packard contemplated more than a course of lectures on theology in
<pb n="78" id="p.78"/>
connection with the college curriculum, but the Trustees
deemed it advisable to constitute a distinct theological
department.</p>
<p> The Rev. Thomas J. Sawyer, D. D., was elected Packard
Professor of Christian Theology and placed at the head of
the school; and the Rev. Charles H. Leonard, A. M., of
Chelsea, was made Goddard Professor of Sacred Rhetoric
and Pastoral Theology. After a delay of nearly two years,
occasioned by the settlement of the Packard estate, the school
was formally opened in October, 1869, with four students in
attendance, Abner Crosby Fish, William  Willis Hayward,
William Henry Ryder, and William George Tousey. All except the first mentioned completed the course.</p>
<p> The Catalogue of 1869-70 shows two names on the list of
instructors, five on that of students, and six on that of the
Visiting Committee. Among the members of this committee
were Dr. Thayer and Dr. Paige. The school year extended
from the first Wednesday in October to the second Wednesday in July; the regular course was three years, permission
to take a fourth year being obtainable, but special courses
were arranged under certain circumstances.</p>
<p> No charge for tuition was made, and the General Convention of Universalists began, with the opening of the school,
the present practice of lending money to poor but worthy
students. The amount which might be borrowed annually
by a student was at that time one hundred and eighty dollars, but it has since been reduced to one hundred and fifty.</p>
<p> The accommodations of the school were at that time decidedly meagre. A small room on the second floor of Ballou Hall
served as a recitation and lecture room for all the classes,
and the students found lodgings wherever they could.</p>
<p> However, the school throve and grew steadily. During its
second year there were twelve students in attendance, and
by the third year the number had increased to twenty. To
meet the increased demands, the teaching force was <pb n="79" id="p.79"/>augmented, and with the Fall of 1872 the Rev. William G.
Tousey, A. M., who had completed his course the previous
June, was enrolled on the Faculty as instructor in Psychology and Natural Theology.</p>
<p> A glance at the list of lecturers for this year is interesting
as indicating the broad and progressive policy which from the
first characterized the management of the school. It comprised the names of the Rev. Thomas B. Thayer, D. D., on
Christian Evidences; the Rev. A. St. John Chambr&#x00E9;, A. M.,
on Ecclesiastical History; the Rev. E. C. Bolles, Ph. D., on
The Relations of Science to Christianity; and Rev. Elmer
H. Capen, A. M., on The Study of Language, -its Value to
the Theological Student. Among the students in the Junior
Class of this year appear the names of George Milford
Harmon and George Thomson Knight.</p>
<p> The Catalogue of 1872-73 announces that hereafter the
degree of Bachelor of Divinity will be granted to all who
complete the regular three years course, if they have previously passed through a regular course of academic study;
others will receive it only at the end of a four years course.
And for the first time a regular four years program is
outlined.</p>
<p> When West Hall was built, in 1872, the western half of it
was assigned to the use of the Divinity School. The rooms
on the first floor were used for recitations and lectures, and
those above for dormitories. No charge was made to the
students for rental. One of the back rooms on the first floor
was fitted up as a chapel, and here began the separate chapel
services conducted by the students in turn, which have ever
since been a feature in the school.</p>
<p>  But West Hall was from the first considered only a temporary home for the school. The ambition of the Faculty
was a separate building or buildings, and for nearly twenty
years there is hardly a President's Report which does not
urge the need of better and separate accommodations for the

<pb n="80" id="p.80"/>
Divinity School. The reports of the Dean during the same
period all contain earnest appeals for funds, buildings, and a
theological library.  In the light of subsequent events, Dr.
Miner's own words, in his report as President for 1873-74,
are interesting. He said: " It is hoped that some friend of
the school will ere long appear who will honor himself by
providing it a building adequate to its needs."</p>
<p> But no such friend appeared, and year by year the necessity
increased with the growth of the school. " We need, almost
beyond the power of language to express, a divinity hall," says
Dr. Sawyer in his report of 1886-87. As the college proper increased in size, the quarters of the school in West Hall were
needed for other purposes, and the appeals for a new building
became more and more urgent with each year, until, in 1891,
Dr. Miner " honored himself" by the gift of the beautiful hall
which bears his name.</p>
<p> Let us return now to the year 1874. At that time the
course for those who had received academic training was
divided into the Junior, Middle, and Senior years, while of
those not so prepared a Sub-Junior year of preparatory work
was required. The same arrangement is in operation at the
present time.</p>
<p> The Juniors studied, under Dr. Sawyer, English Grammar
and Language, an Introduction to the Jewish Scriptures,
Biblical Arch&#x00E6;ology, Hebrew, and the Old Testament: under
Professor Leonard, Biblical History and Geography: and
under Professor Tousey, Rhetoric, Greek, and Logic. To the
Middle Class Dr. Sawyer taught an Introduction to the study
of the Gospels, and the Greek of the New Testament: Professor Leonard, Church History and Homiletics: and Professor
Tousey, Rhetoric, Logic, and Mental Science. The Seniors
studied Exegesis and Systematic Theology with Dr. Sawyer;
Homiletics, History of Doctrine, and Christian Evidences,
with Professor Leonard; and Moral Science with Professor
Tousey.</p>

<pb n="81" id="p.81"/>
<p> The beginning of the year 1875-76 saw another name added
to the list of instructors. The Rev. George T. Knight, A. M.,
a graduate of the class of 1875, was given charge of the departments of Rhetoric, Biblical History, Church History, and
Greek. The following year a course in Oratory was added,
under Professor Moses T. Brown, of the College of Letters.</p>
<p> Despite its serious limitations in the lack of proper quarters
and sufficient funds, the school continued to prosper and grow
both in size and efficiency. The catalogue of 1877-78 shows
an attendance of twenty-five students, and the following words
from President Capen's report of that year speak well for
the character and reputation of the school. He says: " Its
work has been examined by able men in our own church
and other churches, who have borne emphatic testimony of
approval.  Presided over by our foremost living scholar,
assisted by men who in their special departments have no
superiors, the character and quality of its teaching could
scarcely be improved. Indeed, I am satisfied, from careful
scrutiny and a wide observation, that in the scope and
thoroughness of its work it is equalled by few theological
schools in this country, and by none surpassed. Moreover,
the manner in which, by common report, those who have
gone out from the school are discharging the duties of their
profession, shows that their training is not wanting in those
practical elements which are essential to the successful parish
minister."</p>
<p> In 1879 a Jew, Bernard Maimon, A. M., was secured as
Instructor of Hebrew Language and Literature, and taught
in the school for one year.</p>
<p> In 1882 was inaugurated a change significant of the fact
that the Divinity School was not a separate institution, but
a part of the college. This was the abolition of the Divinity
School Anniversary, which up to this time had been celebrated
a week before the College Commencement, and which was in
reality a separate Commencement for the school. From that
<pb n="82" id="p.82"/>

time the school has had a place on the regular Commencement
program.</p>
<p> For nearly ten years nothing of especial importance occurred
in the history of the school. The increase of attendance was
good, there being at the end of that time thirty-five students
in all, with a teaching force enlarged to meet the growing
requirements. In 1882 Dr. Sawyer was given the title of
Dean, but his advancing age made it necessary for him to
retire from active work, and after 1884 his labors in the
school were confined to a few lectures. Dr. Leonard succeeded him as the head of the Faculty, though not receiving
the title of Dean until 1892, when Dr. Sawyer was made
Emeritus. In 1883 the Rev. George M. Harmon, A. M., was
appointed Assistant Professor of Theology, Professor Tousey
was made Secretary of the Faculty, and Mr. Knight was made
Professor of Church History. The following year Professor
Tousey resigned the secretaryship, and was succeeded in the
office by Professor Knight. In 1889 Assistant Professor
Harmon was made Professor of Biblical Theology. With the
beginning of the year 1890-91 the Rev. A. B. Curtis, Ph. D.,
was appointed Instructor in Hebrew and Old Testament
Subjects, to be advanced in 1894 to the title of Professor.</p>
<p> In 1891, as has been said, the school received its first great
benefaction since the original bequest of Mr. Packard, in the
gift by Dr. Miner of the beautiful Divinity Hall named in his
honor. At the commencement of that year Dr. Miner announced his intention of giving forty thousand dollars for a
building to be devoted exclusively to the use of the School of
Theology; adding however, that in his judgment "such a
building should not be erected until the sum of twelve thousand dollars is in hand for the erection at the same time of
an accompanying dormitory for the students of the school."
To President Capen and Dr. Leonard is due most of the credit
for raising the required twelve thousand dollars for the
dormitory building. Men of means were written to, parishes
<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00091.00007" id="f13"><head>Paige Hall and Miner Hall</head></figure>

<pb n="83" id="p.83"/>
were visited and funds solicited, and, sufficient money having
been raised to pay for the building, the neighboring parishes
were invited to contribute one hundred dollars each to furnish
the rooms. The result was that within a year, Paige Hall,
comfortable if not beautiful, was finished and furnished.
Meantime work had progressed on Miner Hall, and on June
13, 1892, it was dedicated with appropriate exercises.</p>
<p> One room in the building was set aside and fitted up as a
library; another forms a cosey little chapel; a third was
furnished as a reception room by Dr. and Mrs. Miner; and the
Miner Charitable Society of the Columbus Avenue Church
furnished a room for the use of the Faculty. The admirable
furnishings and beautiful adornments of the two rooms last
mentioned are due to the good taste of Miss Hetty Williams,
of Boston. The furnishings of the lecture rooms were the
gift of the donor of the building.</p>
<p> The opening of the college year of 1892-93 was made memorable by the occupancy of the new buildings, and for the
first time in its history the school found itself in adequate
and comfortable quarters.</p>
<p> With the beginning of the same year the Divinity School,
as well as the college, was opened to women, and three
entered, one in the regular course and two as special students.</p>
<p> In 1891 Professor Maulsby, who had succeeded Professor
Brown in the department of Oratory, assumed the direction
of that work in the school, and in 1894 the Rev. Warren S.
Woodbridge was appointed Woodbridge Professor of Applied
Christianity, the chair having been endowed by Mr. Samuel
F. Woodbridge, of North Cambridge.</p>
<p> Beside the gifts and endowments already mentioned-Mr. Packard's original bequest, Dr. Miner's munificent donation, the subscriptions for Paige Hall, and Mr. Woodbridge's
endowment - the school has received little direct financial
aid. The following named persons have, however, shown
their interest in its welfare substantially and generously.</p>

<pb n="84" id="p.84"/>
<p> Mr. George A. Dockstader, of New York, has given within
the past ten years ten thousand dollars, the income of which
is appropriated at the discretion of the Faculty to the aid of
needy and worthy students.</p>
<p> Mrs. Eliza M. Greenwood, of Malden, bequeathed one thousand dollars, the income of which is given in prizes to members of the school for excellence in oratory. The Greenwood
prize readings are now a feature of the school year.</p>
<p> Rev. John Vannevar gave five hundred dollars to Dr.
Leonard in recognition of certain services in graduate studies;
and the income of this sum the latter has generously devoted
to the purchase of books for the department of Homiletics.</p>
<p> For several years Rev. W. S. Perkins, D. D., of Meriden,
Connecticut, has provided a prize of twenty-five dollars to
encourage extemporaneous preaching.</p>
<p> Although it still has some needs - among the most urgent,
perhaps, being a dormitory for women -The Tufts Divinity
School may be said to have passed through its days of trial,
and can now calmly await what may come. With admirable
material equipment and a thoroughly able corps of instructors
it is in a position to do its work well; and its rapidly enlarging body of alumni is spreading its credit and influence not
only throughout the denomination which it represents, but
throughout the country at large.</p>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="CHAPTER SIXTH:THE MEDICAL SCHOOL." id="c3s6">
<head>CHAPTER SIXTH:THE MEDICAL SCHOOL.</head>
<pb n="85" id="p.85"/>

<p>IT is easy to see, in tracing the development of Tufts College, that it will not be many years before it will be
justified in assuming the more pretentious title of University.
The latest step to be taken in this direction was the organization of the Medical School. Twice in the history of the
college - the last time in 1885 - applications for incorporation were received from medical institutions, but the Trustees reported "inexpedient" in each case; and not until
August 28, 1893, was a vote passed establishing such a school
in connection with the college.</p>
<p> Doctors Dudley, Nott, Thayer, Hall, Chipman, Johnson,
and Wheatley were the original organizers of the school.
These gentlemen were members of the Faculty of the Boston
College of Physicians and Surgeons; but becoming dissatisfied with the condition which affairs were rapidly assuming
at that institution, they resigned, formed a school of their
own, and made application to the Trustees of Tufts College
for incorporation, agreeing, however, to retain the entire
responsibility for the school during the first three years of
its existence.</p>
<p> They held the first regular Faculty meeting August 29,
1893, at which arrangements were made for announcements.
At this meeting professorships were established in Physiology
and Hygiene, Anatomy, Pathology, Surgery, Practice of
Medicine, Obstetrics, Materia Medica and Therapeutics, and
Gyn&#x00E6;cology.  Dr. Albert Nott was appointed Professor of
Physiology, Dr. Charles P. Thayer Professor of General, <pb n="86" id="p.86"/>Descriptive, and Surgical Anatomy, Dr. Henry W. Dudley Professor of Pathology, Dr. William R. Chipman Professor of
the Principles and Practice of Surgery and Operative Surgery,
Dr. Walter L. Hall Professor of the Principles and Practice
of Medicine and Clinical Medicine, Dr. John W. Johnson
Professor of Obstetrics and Gyn&#x00E6;cology, Dr. Frank G.
Wheatley Professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics.
Drs. Austin, Tenney, Webber, and Hutchinson were appointed lecturers, Drs. Knowlton and Peirce demonstrators,
and Drs. Raddin, White, Thorpe, and Cutler assistants. Dr.
Nott was elected Dean, Dr. Thayer Secretary, and Dr. Johnson Treasurer of the School.</p>
<p> The building at 188 Boylston Street, Boston, was taken
September 1, 1893, and the first course of lectures opened
October 4th of that year.</p>
<p> The object of the school since its beginning has been to
provide a thorough course of instruction in medical science
at moderate charges, and open to both sexes on equal terms.
In the brief time at the disposal of the authorities it was
impossible to obtain quarters for the school which were altogether satisfactory, but since the opening the facilities have
been greatly improved, and no pains have been spared in
equipping the school, to make the instruction thorough, complete, and practical.</p>
<p> The course of study at present consists of a three years
graded course of didactic and clinical lectures and recitations,
but after this year a four years course will be required.</p>
<p> During the past year the clinical and other advantages
have been greatly increased, so that the school is prepared to
offer every opportunity needed by the undergraduate in medicine. The corps of instruction has been also strengthened
by the addition to the Faculty of such well-known men
as Samuel G. Webber, A. B., M. D., Professor of Neurology;
Ernest W. Cushing, A. B., M. D., Professor of Gyn&#x00E6;cology;
Arthur E. Austin, A. B., M. D., Professor of Medical <pb n="87" id="p.87"/>Chemistry; Charles A. Pitkin, A. M., Ph. D., Professor of General
Chemistry; Harold Williams, A. B., M. D., Clinical Professor of Pediatrics; John A. Tenney, M. D., Professor of Ophthalmology; John L. Hildreth, A. B., M. D., Professor of
Clinical Medicine; Herbert L. Smith, A. M., M. D., Professor of Clinical Surgery; Thomas M. Durell, M. D., Professor
of Medical Jurisprudence; and Frederick L. Jack, M. D.,
Professor of Otology; and to the list of instructors, lecturers, and assistants, William  R. Woodbury, A. B., M. D.,
George A. Webster, M. D., Fred H. Morse, M. D., Frank B.
Brown, M. D., William P. Derby, M. D., Charles G. Cumston,
M. D., E. C. Stowell, M. D., Albert E. Rogers, M. D., T. A.
Mighill, Ph. D., T. F. Greene, M. D., J. C. D. Clark, M. D.,
H. S. Dearing, M. D., H. W. White, M. D., W. J. Otis, M. D.,
and W. S. Boardman, M. D. Professor J. S. Kingsley, of the
College of Letters, served as lecturer on Histology during the
first two years of the school, being succeeded by G. A. Bates,
D. D. S., in 1895.</p>
<p> The enrolment of students for the college year 1893-94
was eighty, and twenty-two were graduated with the degree
of Doctor of Medicine at Commencement in June, 1894, eight
of this number being women.</p>
<p> For 1894-95, ninety-six students were entered, the graduating class numbering nineteen, while for the present year
(1895-96) there are one hundred and seventy-three matriculates.</p>
<p> Owing to the rapid increase in students, the building, although the school occupies three complete stories, including
lecture rooms, laboratories, reading rooms, dissecting room,
etc., has become overcrowded, and a hall on the corner of
Boylston and Tremont Streets has been leased as an additional lecture room.</p>
<p> As the school is the only co-educational school in New
England which is recognized by the Massachusetts Medical
Society, it has a field of its own. This, with the certainty of

<pb n="88" id="p.88"/>
a new building very soon, with the constantly increasing
clinical advantages, with the hearty indorsement of the medical profession in this part of the country, and the rapid
increase in the number of students, assures a brilliant and
prosperous future for Tufts College Medical School.</p>

HOSEA BALLOU, 2d, was born in Guilford, Vermont,
October 13, 1796. He was the son of Asahel Ballou,
and the grand-nephew of Hosea Ballou, who at that time
was just coming into prominence as a preacher. A few
years after the birth of Hosea, Asahel Ballou removed with
his family to the adjacent town of Halifax.  Here the boyhood of young Hosea was spent, as that of many another
country lad has been, working upon the farm during the
summer, and attending the district school whenever opportunity offered. It soon became evident that the lad had a
taste for books, and hopes were entertained that he might
be able to obtain a college education. His acquaintance
with the classics began with his studying Latin under the
tutorage of a clergyman by the name of Thomas Wood, and
his rapid advance in the study of the language proved him to
be an apt scholar. While he was scarcely more than a boy
his mind began to be occupied with the questions of religion,
and for a time his inclinations were toward the doctrines
of the Baptist Church, but the influence of his father and
great-uncle finally turned them toward Universalism. Thoroughly imbued with this belief, and possessing a great gift
of eloquence, it was not unnatural that he should adopt the
ministry as his profession. He accordingly studied theology,
and in a short time was prepared for his work.</p>
<p> His first pastoral settlement was at Stafford, Connecticut,
where the Universalists had just erected a church, and
where he was invited to minister upon the recommendation
of his great-uncle Hosea.  He remained at Stafford for
nearly five years, and while there was married, January 26,

<pb n="92" id="p.92"/>
1820, to Miss Clarissa Hatch, of Halifax, Vermont. He
resigned to accept a call to preside over a newly built church
in Roxbury, Massachusetts, where he was installed as pastor
July 26, 1821. The young minister discharged his duties
devoutly and faithfully, winning many hearts by the simplicity and serenity of his life, his strong sense of justice,
and his admirable discretion.</p>
<p> In the Spring of 1822 he became associated with the Rev.
Thomas Whittemore of Cambridgeport in editing the " Universalist Magazine," and by means of this publication the
two men exerted a wide influence throughout the denomination. About the year 1824 he proposed to Mr. Whittemore
the plan of writing a history of Universalism. He, Mr.
Ballou, was to trace the growth of the liberal faith from
ancient times to the epoch of the Reformation, where Mr.
Whittemore was to take up the work, continuing it to the
present time. The "Ancient History of Universalism " was
published in five volumes, in 1829. The five years spent by
Mr. Ballou in completing this publication were years of
exhaustive research and tireless activity; and the work
stands to-day as a fitting monument to his zeal and scholarship. To him must largely be attributed the rise of the
"Universalist Expositor," - afterward the "Universalist
Quarterly," - to which he was a constant contributor during
the years from 1830 to 1840. In 1833 he wrote an introduction to the American edition of Sismondi's "Crusades against
the Albigenses," and in 1837 he published a "Collection of
Psalms and Hymns for the Use of Universalist Families."
Later he contributed many articles to the "Trumpet," "Universalist Quarterly," and some secular reviews.</p>
<p> After a pastorate of seventeen years, Mr. Ballou left
Roxbury to settle over the parish at Medford, Massachusetts,
in June, 1838. Here he continued preaching, almost under
the shadow of Walnut Hill, until called to spend his best
endeavors and accomplish their richest results within the

<pb n="93" id="p.93"/>

building upon its summit to which an affectionate remembrance has since given his name.</p>
<p> During his pastorate at Medford, Mr. Ballou's reputation
for scholarship was steadily on the increase. Some of the
work done by him was truly wonderful. Like Cicero he
began to read Greek when no longer young, mastering the
difficulties of the language with a marvellous perseverance.
He also became familiar with the modern languages, and
studied a great deal on scientific lines. His prestige in
literary circles around Boston was considerable, and in
August, 1845, Harvard University conferred upon him the
degree of Doctor of Divinity. He was the first Universalist
to receive this honor, and he deserved it well. In the same
year he was elected a member of the Board of Overseers of
Harvard, and during his term of service was looked upon by
his associates as a judicious, upright, and conscientious
worker.</p>
<p> Dr. Ballou was one of the prime movers in the founding
of Tufts College. For years the establishment of a college
under the auspices of the Universalist Church had been his
favorite project, and when the opportunity offered he threw
himself into the work heart and soul. He and Mr. Whittemore were co-workers with Dr. Sawyer in arranging for the
"Educational Convention" of May 18, 1847; and when, on
the fifteenth of the following September, he preached the
occasional sermon before the General Convention, he uttered
so eloquent an appeal for a movement on behalf of education
that enthusiasm was aroused in all quarters, and Universalists throughout the land were ready and eager to give to the
good cause when the call for contributions came.</p>
<p> When Dr. Sawyer declined the presidency of the new college it was offered, in 1853, to Dr. Ballou, but it was with
great hesitation that he accepted the responsible position.
He doubted his fitness for the place, and feared that his lack
of college training would be an impediment to his usefulness;

<pb n="94" id="p.94"/>
but he could not fail to see that after the refusal of Dr.
Sawyer he was the man to whom the task naturally fell, and
accepting with quiet resolution what he believed to be his
duty, he took up the work. Being granted leave of absence
for a year he went to England and studied methods of teaching in the universities there. His formal inauguration took
place August 25, 1855, and from that time until his death
he discharged the duties of his office with unswerving fidelity
and with honor to himself and to the institution under his
care.</p>
<p> President Ballou died May 21, 1861, worn out by overwork. His funeral occurred on the 31st. It was a beautiful
day, and a special train from Boston brought to the Hill
hundreds of friends who had loved and honored the departed
President. Private services at the family residence were
conducted by Dr. Leonard, after which the casket was
escorted to the chapel by the officers and students of the
college, all of whom wore bands of black crape upon the left
arm. After an impressive service, in which an eloquent
tribute was paid to Dr. Ballou by Dr. Miner, the body was
borne to Mount Auburn Cemetery, where it was laid to rest.</p>
<p> Mrs. Ballou survived her husband nearly fifteen years,
dying April 30, 1876. They had seven children, all of
whom have joined their parents in the other life.</p>
<p> Dr. Ballou was a splendid example of the possibilities of a
self-educated man. With a little more than a common-school
education, he made for himself by steady and persevering
work a place among the scholars of his day. Endowed no
doubt with a wonderful intellect, his greatest successes were
largely due to his untiring industry. Many of his contemporaries may have excelled him in brilliancy of scholarship,
- probably few in solid attainment and soundness of learning. He ranked among the foremost theologians of his time,
and was a strict moralist and rigid disciplinarian; but he
had a warm heart and a fund of kindly humor which render

<pb n="95" id="p.95"/>
his memory dear to his surviving friends. Modest and unassuming in his manners, the influence of his character was
felt by all who knew him. He was worthy to be called
by that most honorable of titles, -a cultured Christian
gentleman.</p>

ALONZO AMES MINER, son of Benajah Ames and
    Amanda (Carey) Miner, was born in Lempster, Sullivan County, New Hampshire, August 17, 1814. He was the
grandson of Charles Miner, a Revolutionary soldier, and a
descendant of Thomas Miner, who came to Charlestown,
Massachusetts, in 1630. The family name is derived from
Henry Bellman, a miner, who was granted a coat of arms by
Edward III. in recognition of services rendered in fitting out
troops.</p>
<p> Alonzo Miner received his early education in the district
schools, but studied later at Hopkinton, Lebanon, and
Franklin, New Hampshire, and Cavendish, Vermont.</p>
<p> From his sixteenth to his twentieth year he taught in the
public schools, and during the year 1834-35 was associated
with James Garvin in conducting the Cavendish Academy.
From 1835 to 1839 he was Principal of the Unity (New
Hampshire) Scientific and Military Academy.</p>
<p> At this time the preceptress of the school was Miss Maria
S. Perley, of Lempster, New Hampshire, whom Mr. Miner
married August 24, 1836.</p>
<p> The young man had formed an earnest desire to enter the
ministry, and although his health was poor, and his friends
feared that his life would be short, he received the fellowship
of the Universalist Church in 1838, and was ordained as a
minister in 1839. His first sermon was preached in Chester,
Vermont, in February, 1838. For a time, in response to
urgent requests, he continued his duties at the Academy;
but in May he began regular ministerial work, preaching
half the time in Unity and the other half in about twenty

<pb n="97" id="p.97"/>
neighboring villages. His subsequent pastorates were few,
but very successful. In 1839 he was called to Methuen,
Massachusetts, where he remained for three years, resigning
to accept a call to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he served a
pastorate of six years. In 1848 he came to Boston, and succeeded the Rev. E. H. Chapin, D. D., as colleague of the
venerable Hosea Ballou at the Second Universalist Church.
As the successor of Mr. Ballou he continued to preside over
this parish until his death.</p>
<p> Wherever he went Mr. Miner soon made his influence felt
in educational matters. He served on the School Boards of
Methuen, Lowell, and Boston, and on the Board of Overseers
of Harvard College. He was a member of the Massachusetts
State Board of Education for nearly twenty-five years, and
for about twenty years was Chairman of the Board of Visitors
of the State Normal Art School, in the establishment of
which he had been largely instrumental. He served as
Secretary of the Trustees of Tufts College, and also as a
member of the Executive Committee for some years prior to
his election as President of the college in 1862.</p>
<p> The honorary degree of A. M. was conferred upon him by
Tufts in 1861, that of S. T. D. by Harvard in 1863, and that
of LL. D. by Tufts in 1875. He was made an honorary
member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1893.</p>
<p> Dr. Miner was President of Tufts College from 1862 until
1875, and under his administration the growth in the material prosperity of the college was very great. He did not
relinquish his Boston pastorate, nor did he ever reside at the
Hill, but for the college, as for everything else with which
he had to do, his remarkable executive ability accomplished
large results. He resigned the presidency because he felt
that it, as well as his pastorate, required the entire attention of its incumbent, but he continued to serve the
Trustees as a member of the Executive Committee until his
death.</p>

<pb n="98" id="p.98"/>
<p> He was also President of the Trustees of the Bromfield
School at Harvard, Massachusetts, of Dean Academy, and of
the Universalist Publishing House. Of the last he was also
President of the Directors, having been the originator of the
plan of its establishment. He was a pioneer of the first
Universalist Home Mission; and was a member of the
American Academy of Political and Social Science, and of
the Executive Committee of the American Peace Society.</p>
<p> Dr. Miner was known throughout the country as an uncompromising champion of the cause of temperance. He was
President of the Massachusetts Temperance Alliance for
twenty years, and allowed his name to be used on the Prohibition ticket for the governorship of the State when every
other candidate had been frightened from the field. Under
Mayor Cobb he served on a committee of three members
appointed to consider the treatment of drunkenness in the
institutions of Boston.</p>
<p> Among the almost numberless eloquent addresses, orations,
and sermons which Dr. Miner delivered during his life may
be mentioned the address at the laying of the corner stone of
the first building of Tufts College, the civic oration in
Boston on July 4th, 1855, a sermon which was largely
influential in the founding of the Girls' High School in
Boston, and the election sermon before the Massachusetts
Legislature in 1884, which he handled so severely that the
law providing for an annual election sermon was repealed.
As most of his literary productions were delivered from the
pulpit or platform, but few have been preserved, except as
they were reported in the papers. A few books and magazine articles from his pen, however, have been published.
He contributed to the " Bibliotheca Sacra " a paper on the
"Doctrines of Universalism," wrote a chapter in "The
Unknown Country" on "Eschatology," and was the author
of the "History of Universalism" in the "Memorial History
of Boston." He also published "Old Forts Taken," which

<pb n="99" id="p.99"/>
has been issued in several editions, as has also his "Bible
Exercises for Sunday Schools."</p>
<p> The causes which Dr. Miner espoused did not benefit by
his voice alone. When he believed in a thing his purse was
ready at its service also. Among other gifts to Tufts College was the sum of forty thousand dollars for building the
theological hall which bears his name. By his will he left
two thousand dollars each to Westbrook Seminary, Goddard
Seminary, and Dean Academy, and made the college his
residuary legatee.</p>
<p> Dr. Miner's death occurred on Class Day, June 14, 1895.
His illness was short, and he was active to the last. But a
week before his death an editor of this History called upon
him for information regarding his administration of the
college. With characteristic method, the Doctor promised
to consider the matter carefully and write out the desired
notes. They never were written. Dr. Miner was very busy,
and before he found time to prepare them the end came.
His wife was so overcome by his death that she fell ill, and
but six weeks later went to join the companion of her life.</p>
<p> The death of Dr. Miner was looked upon as a public misfortune. Even his enemies, and he had many, respected him
and mourned his loss. A fearless champion of truth, he
never stooped for a moment to cater to public opinion, but
took his stand where he saw the right, and faced all its foes
unflinchingly. Some have called him narrow-minded, but
they did not know him. He first surveyed a subject in its
entirety, and then adopted and clove to that side of it which
he felt to be the right one. Quick to see evil, he was also
quick to strike at its root, and struck without mercy; but he
fought against principles, not men, and had a keen appreciation of manhood in the ranks of his friends or enemies.</p>
<p> Perhaps the finest tribute paid to Dr. Miner upon his death
came from the lips of his successor, President Capen. The
occasion was the Baccalaureate Sermon to the Class of

<pb n="100" id="p.100"/>
Ninety-five, delivered in Goddard Chapel on the sixteenth of
June. Dr. Miner's picture hung at the back of the chancel,
and President Capen, after referring to such grand examples
of the ministry as E. H. Chapin, Thomas Starr King, and
Phillips Brooks, turned toward the portrait and said: "To
these names I may now add the name of the fearless champion
of truth and righteousness, who lies dead upon his shield
in yonder city, -the great, uncompromising, indomitable
Christian warrior, who, though past the age of four score
years, has fallen in the thick of the fight with his armor on."</p>

<p><figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.02672" id="f16"><head>Elmer H. Capen</head></figure>
ELMER HEWITT CAPEN was born in Stoughton,
Norfolk County, Massachusetts, April 5, 1838. He
received his preparatory education at Pierce Academy in
Middleborough and at the Green Mountain Institute in
Woodstock, Vermont, and entered Tufts College in the
Fall of 1856. Here he was known as a brilliant scholar
and thorough student. The Kappa Charge of Theta Delta
Chi was instituted during his Freshman year, and he became one of its charter members.</p>
<p> The people of his native town early recognized his ability,
for while he was yet an undergraduate they elected him to
the Massachusetts Legislature, where he served during the
year 1859-60. Mr. Capen was at this time but twenty-one
years of age, and by some years the youngest member of the
representative body in which he took his seat. Few young
men would have withstood the temptation to enter political
life thus offered; but, feeling that he should prepare himself
more thoroughly for work in the world, Mr. Capen went
quietly back to college at the expiration of his term. In
1860 he graduated with his Class, and at once began the
study of law with Thomas S. Harlow, of Boston. Early in
1864 he was admitted to the bar, but he never practised, for
a desire to enter the ministry had taken possession of his
mind, and he studied theology with the Rev. A. St. John
Chambr&#x00E9;. During the year 1864 he preached, and in 1865
was ordained as a minister in the Independent Christian
Church in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Here he enjoyed an
exceedingly pleasant and successful pastorate of four years,
at the end of which time he went to preside over a church


<pb n="102" id="p.102"/>
in St. Paul, Minnesota, leaving behind him many warm
friends.</p>
<p> Mr. Capen remained in St. Paul for a year, and then
accepted a call from the First Universalist Parish in Providence, Rhode Island. The church was then situated on
Westminster Street, but this property was sold soon after
his arrival, and the society purchased a lot on the corner of
Green and Washington Streets. By dint of energetic work
on the part of the pastor and hearty co-operation on the part
of the congregation, a fine new building was ready for dedication in 1872. Mr. Capen remained in Providence for
three years after the completion of the new church, resigning
his pastorate in 1875 to accept the presidency of his Alma
Mater.</p>
<p> President Capen's first marriage was to Miss Letitia H.
Mussey, of New London, Connecticut. She died, and in
February, 1877, he married Miss Mary L. Edwards, of Brookline, Massachusetts. They have three children, - Samuel
P., a member of the Sophomore Class in the college, Ruth
P., and Rosamund E.</p>
<p> The period of President Capen's administration has been
one of marked growth for Tufts. He is a man of progressive
ideas and great common sense in applying them. He is
thoroughly in touch with all student interests, and the celebration of an athletic victory would be incomplete indeed
without a word of congratulation and encouragement from
his lips. Never forgetful of his own youth, his sympathy
with student fun and his charity for innocent escapades are
as marked as his quick censure of any act beneath the dignity of a gentleman, and his firm sense of justice in all
matters connected with his administrative work.</p>
<p> President Capen's success at Tufts is the more noteworthy
in consideration of the numerous duties which he has to
perform. In addition to the work of administration, he conducts alone the department of Political Science, in which

<pb n="103" id="p.103"/>
four courses are offered, and also regularly supplies the college pulpit. Besides all this he has to meet the various
obligations imposed upon him by the position of acknowledged importance which he occupies in the educational
world. He is an eloquent orator, and his services are constantly in demand at social, religious, educational, and
political gatherings. He was very active in the establishment of Dean Academy, and served as the first Secretary of
its Trustees. When the original academy building was
destroyed by fire, he served as secretary of the committee
having in charge the erection of a new building, and it is
largely owing to him that the present structure is so decided
an improvement on its predecessor. He has been President
of the New England Commission on Admission Examinations since its establishment. For twenty years he was a
Trustee of the Universalist General Convention. He is
Chairman of the State Board of Education, of which he has
been a member for several years. He is Chairman of the
Board of Visitors of the Salem Normal School, and has in
charge the erection of its new building, which, when completed, will probably be the finest normal school building
in the country.  He is also Chairman of the Building
Committee of the new   school-house in Fitchburg.  He
was President of the Citizens' Law and Order League
during the entire period of its active existence; and in
1888 he served as a delegate to the Republican National
Convention.</p>
<p> Dr. Capen contributed the article on the "Philosophy of
Universalism " in the " Latest Word of Universalism;" the
article on the "Atonement," in the Universalist Section of
the Columbian Congress; the article on Universalism in
Hertzog's "Religious Cyclop&#x00E6;dia," and the articles on Universalism and Tufts College in the "Encyclop&#x00E6;dia Britannica." He is also the author of a portion of the "Bible
History" recently published by a Chicago house. He has

<pb n="104" id="p.104"/>

written a number of magazine articles, and many of his
Baccalaureate Sermons have been published.</p>
<p> Dr. Capen was one of the principal founders of the Mystic
Valley Club, and served as its President for five years. He
is a member of the Twentieth Century Club, and was one of
the organization members of the Delta Chapter of Massachusetts of Phi Beta Kappa. Saint Lawrence University conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1879.</p>

JOHN POTTER MARSHALL was born in Kingston, New
Hampshire, August 11, 1823. Both his parents were
of the old New England stock, his mother being the great
granddaughter of Governor Dudley.   Both were strong
Universalists.</p>
<p> The boy began his preparation for college at the academy
in Kingston, and afterward spent two years at Atkinson
Academy. At the age of sixteen he was prepared to enter
college; but his father, who was a practical man, considered
him too young, and advised his pursuing for a time some
trade which would furnish opportunity for physical development. He accordingly went to Boston, and spent the next
year working as a builder of carriages.</p>
<p> In 1840 he entered Yale, where he steadily maintained a
position in the front rank of his class, graduating at the end
of four years with honors. Owing to the illness of his brother
he was unable to be present on Commencement Day to deliver
the part which he had prepared.</p>
<p> The winter after graduation he began teaching at a Baptist
academy in Effingham, New Hampshire, where he remained
for two years, resigning to become Principal of the Lebanon
(New Hampshire) Liberal Institute, where he remained for
two years more. He then spent some time in the South
with his invalid brother, and upon his return began teaching in his native town, from which he went not long after
to Danvers, Massachusetts, to become Principal of a high
school just opened there. While there he joined the Mt.
Lebanon Lodge of Masons in Boston. At Danvers, Mr.
Marshall was visited by Dr. Leonard, who was then a <pb n="106" id="p.106"/>member of the Chelsea School Committee, and soon after he
received a call to become Principal of the Chelsea High
School. Here he taught most successfully, until he received
the offer of a professorship in the new college, together with
an urgent request that he would consent to lend his aid to
the work of its establishment. After serious consideration
Mr. Marshall decided to accept the professorship. The salary
was very small, and the work much more difficult than that
in which he was engaged; but he felt that it was his duty as
a Universalist to aid the advancement of the college by every
means in his power.</p>
<p> Professor Marshall at first had charge of all the scientific
work of the college, teaching Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Natural History, and also Senior French.
Later, as the college grew, and new instructors were engaged,
his burdens were gradually lightened, until only Mineralogy
and Geology remained. These branches, which are his
favorites, he is still teaching.</p>
<p> Professor Marshall was Dr. Ballou's most active assistant
in the work of organization, and for the year following the
Doctor's death was acting President of the college. He was
the first Professor to be appointed, and is the present senior
member and Dean of the Faculty. He resided in Medford
for two years after beginning his work in the college, but
then moved to the Hill, where he had built himself a house.
This was the second dwelling-house on the Hill, and is still
occupied by Professor Marshall.</p>
<p> Professor Marshall was married in November, 1853, to
Miss Caroline Clement, of Chelsea, Massachusetts. She was
a beautiful and talented woman, and in the early days of the
college did much to make life on the Hill pleasant for
students and Faculty. She died in February, 1895, leaving
her husband with their two children, a son and a daughter.
During the Civil War, Professor Marshall spent two years
in hospital service in the South. Many urged him to return

<pb n="107" id="p.107"/>

and attend to his college work, but he replied that the many
who were fighting for their country needed him more than
the few who remained behind.</p>
<p> In 1872, being greatly in need of rest, he obtained leave of
absence from the college, and spent fourteen months in visiting England, Germany, and Italy. He passed the winter in
Berlin, studying Mineralogy and Geology. He made another
trip abroad in 1874, travelling principally in Switzerland.</p>
<p> Professor Marshall has always been deeply interested in
general educational matters. He was chiefly instrumental
in the establishment of Sanborn Academy at Kingston, New
Hampshire, and has been a constant visitor to Dean Academy.
He was a member of the State Board of Education for eight
years, and served on the Somerville School Committee for a
long period.</p>
<p> When Professor Marshall came to Tufts he brought with
him a small private collection of minerals and fossils.
Through his earnest efforts this collection has been enlarged
by gifts from various quarters to its present splendid proportions, and the care of it has always remained in his hands.
He is an enthusiast in his work, and not only in the classroom is he ready to impart the knowledge which he has
acquired in a long life of constant activity. In leisure hours
many a student has learned under his painstaking instruction the art of grinding lenses, the intricacies of which
Professor Marshall mastered many years ago in the desire
to supply his laboratory with suitable instruments. His
interest in the young men and women of the college is deep
and personal, and in past years, in cases of sickness or
trouble, he has always been ready to act a father's part.
Gentle, chivalrous, kind-hearted, with that rich old-school
courtesy which is so rare among us in these modern times,
he enjoys the same love and respect from the students of
to-day which he won from their fathers when our Alma
Mater was in its infancy.</p>

<head>  B. F. TWEED, A.M.</head>
<pb n="108" id="p.108"/>

<p>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN TWEED was born in Wakefield (now Reading), Massachusetts, January 17, 1811.</p>
<p> Up to the age of sixteen he attended a district school,
learning the shoemaker's trade during the intervals between
terms. He then attended an academy at Lynnfield, Massachusetts, teaching at various district schools during the
winter months until 1835.</p>
<p> It was his earnest desire to go to college, but the sickness
of an elder brother, together with other conditions in his
father's family, compelled him to give up the cherished
scheme. It was a great disappointment, but the young man
bravely submitted, and began looking about for the position
where he could earn the most money toward the support of
the family.</p>
<p> He soon obtained a school in Medford, Massachusetts, and
for three years taught almost in the shadow of what was
then Walnut Hill, never dreaming of the work which he was
to do in future years upon its summit.</p>
<p> In 1839 Mr. Tweed was offered the principalship of the
Bunker Hill Grammar School in Charlestown, Massachusetts. He accepted, and remained there for ten years, during
which time he became acquainted with Thomas Starr King,
who was engaged at the age of seventeen as his assistant.</p>
<p> Of Mr. King Professor Tweed said: "It was to his quickening influence that I was indebted for the preparation to
fill the place assigned to me in Tufts College. It was
through him that I became intimately acquainted with Dr.
Ballou, and my surprise was great, when, in 1853, the
Doctor informed me that I had been selected for a professorship in a college which was to be."</p>
<p> Mr. Tweed immediately began preparing himself to fill
the place for which he had been chosen, and entered upon


<pb n="109" id="p.109"/>
his new duties with the opening of the institution. The
subjects taught by him were Rhetoric, Logic, and English
Literature. During his entire stay he was exceedingly
popular among the students. There was a wealth of kindly
sympathy in his nature, which, combined with a keen intellect and a fund of dry humor, served to quickly endear him
to the hearts of the young men who came into such intimate
relations with him as then existed between instructor and
pupil.</p>
<p> In 1864 Professor Tweed received a call to the chair of
English Literature and Medi&#x00E6;val and Modern History at
Washington University, in St. Louis, Missouri. Although
he felt loath to leave the young institution at whose birth he
had assisted, the financial inducements offered were too
great to be disregarded, and he accepted the call, remaining
until 1870, when he was invited to take the office of Superintendent of Schools in Charlestown, where he had taught
years before. He held the office of Superintendent for six
years, at the end of which time, Charlestown being incorporated with Boston, he was appointed Supervisor for the
district, holding the position until 1880, when, being advanced in years, he resigned. Shortly afterward the Boston
School Board christened a new grammar school-house in the
Charlestown district the B. F. Tweed Grammar School.</p>
<p> Professor Tweed was interested in most of the Massachusetts educational societies, and was a member of the
American Institute of Instruction, at the first meeting of
which in 1830 he was present. He published several works
on English Grammar and Composition, which have been
widely used as text-books. For several years he edited the
"Massachusetts Teacher," and he always contributed largely
to the leading educational journals.</p>
<p> In 1853, at the time of his beginning his connection with
Tufts College, Harvard University conferred on him the
degree of A. M., in recognition of his scholarship.</p>


<pb n="110" id="p.110"/>
<p> Professor Tweed, having retired from active work, resided
with his daughter and her husband, Judge J. W. Hammond,
of the Class of '61, in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, until his
death on April 2, 1896.</p>

was chosen Professor of Ancient Languages and Classical
Literature, and held this position until 1857, when he

ALPHEUS AUGUSTUS KEEN, son of Simeon and
Sarah (Elwell) Keen, was born in Buckfield, Maine,
September 26, 1824. His early education was received in
the district and high schools of his native town, but his final
preparation for college was made at the Classical Academy
of North Yarmouth.</p>
<p> In 1849 he graduated from Harvard College, and soon
after assumed the office of Principal of the High School for
boys at Marblehead, Massachusetts. For five successful
years he occupied this position, and it was largely through
his influence and effort that the school was made co-educational in 1851.</p>
<p> While teaching at Marblehead Mr. Keen was married, in
1850, to Miss Anna C. Dudley, of Danvers, Massachusetts.
In 1854 he resigned his position to accept the Principalship
of the Academy at Pomeroy, Meigs County, Ohio; and in
the following year a son was born to Mr. and Mrs. Keen, -
Alpheus Augustus, Jr., who is now Cashier of the First
National Bank of Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
<p> Mr. Keen remained in charge of the Pomeroy Academy
until 1857, when he accepted a call to Tufts as Professor of
the Ancient Languages and Literature. Soon after establishing himself at the college he was made Secretary of the
Faculty, which office he held until his death. In 1860 his
title was changed to Professor of the Latin Language and
Literature, the Greek Department having been intrusted to
Dr. Schneider. In 1862 he became Librarian.</p>
<p> In all his relations with the college and elsewhere Professor Keen's gentleness of disposition and nobility of


<pb n="112" id="p.112"/>
character commanded the respect and love of all who knew
him, and no one who has been connected with the institution occupies a tenderer spot in the hearts of the older
alumni. After a considerable period of failing health, he
died on the second day of June, 1864. The funeral was
held in the old chapel room in Ballou Hall, whither the
remains of their beloved teacher were escorted by all the
students, the Faculty and a large number of friends
following.</p>
<p> Professor Keen's body now rests among the hills of his
native home. The influence of his worthy life is embalmed
in the souls which came in contact with his, and were
strengthened and made sweeter thereby. Perhaps we cannot give our readers a true picture of his character better
than by extracting the following paragraph from the
"Trumpet," of June 11, 1864:-</p>

<p> " In the death of Professor Keen the Faculty have lost a most
faithful co-worker, and the students a true and constant friend.
His love of order, his promptness in duty, his quick sense of justice, and withal his tenderness and mercy, were manifest in all
his labors and in all his counsels. His devotion to the country
was sincere and true. Some of his last words indicated that his
thoughts, when dying, were with the brave men offering up their
lives upon its battlefields. Gentle, affectionate, and unostentatious, he early won the respect and esteem of all connected with
the institution; and his loss will be severely felt and deeply
lamented. A memory thus embalmed will be cherished in love
while life remains."</p>

<p> For some years after her husband's death Mrs. Keen was
a member of the cataloguing department of the Boston Public
Library. She now resides with her son in Albuquerque,
New Mexico.</p>

<p>JEROME SCHNEIDER was born September 30, 1824, at
Basel, Switzerland. His early education was received
in the public schools of his native city, where he attended
the primary grade until he was nine years old. He spent
six years at the Gymnasium, graduating there in 1839 to
enter the P&#x00E6;dagogium, a higher preparatory school.</p>
<p> In 1842 he was admitted to the University of Basel, where
he studied Theology and Philology, devoting a great deal of
his time to the study of the Hebrew language. Here he
enjoyed the teaching of Professor Hagenback, a prominent
church historian, and Professor De Wette, one of the foremost liberal theologians of his time.</p>
<p> He continued his studies in 1845-46 at the University of
Berlin, receiving instruction from Professor Zumpt, author
of the famous Latin grammar, and Professor Boekh, a leading Greek scholar. He studied Sanscrit for one term, and
ancient art under Professors Panofka and Gerhard. While
at Berlin he was cast to play the part of Ph&#x00E6;dromus in the
"Curculio " of Plautus, which was produced in Latin before
a distinguished audience.</p>
<p> Herr Schneider returned to Basel in 1846, continuing his
studies of Ancient and Modern Languages, and teaching at
the same time in the Gymnasium. In 1850 he received the
degree of Ph. D. from the University of Basel.</p>
<p> Dr. Schneider came to America in 1854, settling in
Boston. From 1854 to 1856 he was instructor in Modern
Languages in various private schools of Boston. At one of
these he met Professor Tweed, and through him obtained an
introduction to the late Prof. E. W. Gurney, of Harvard.
Through the kindness of the latter he had access to the
recitations of several professors at the college, thereby obtaining an insight into American methods of instruction.</p>


<pb n="114" id="p.114"/>
<p> In 1856 he was appointed instructor of Modern Languages
and Latin at Amherst College during the absence of Professor Tyler in Europe. While there he became an honorary
member of the Amherst Chapter of Psi Upsilon.</p>
<p> On returning to Boston he made, through Professor Tweed,
the acquaintance of President Ballou, and received the
appointment of Instructor in Modern Languages at Tufts
in 1856. At this time he was also appointed Instructor in
Classics and Gymnastics, and in 1860 was made Professor
of the Greek Language and Literature, but he continued to
teach French and German until 1869.</p>
<p> Owing to loss of health he returned to his native country
in 1881, on a year's leave of absence. Regaining his
strength he travelled through Switzerland, Italy, Germany,
France, and England. He spent most of his time, however,
in Germany, visiting the Gymnasia and universities, and
there listening to recitations in various departments. He
returned to Tufts in 1882. He has been a widower for some
years. He has one daughter, the wife of the Rev. Alexander
F. Walsh, who graduated from the Divinity School in 1886.</p>

HEMAN ALLEN DEARBORN was born in Weare,
New Hampshire, May 18, 1831. He had not attended
school many terms when a great fondness for study made
itself manifest, and he formed a strong desire to go to
college.</p>
<p> After attending the Francestown Academy for three terms
he began teaching at the age of seventeen. At this time the
movement to found a college had just begun among the
Universalists, and the young schoolmaster, who wished to
enter the new institution, preferred carrying on his studies
by himself until its opening to matriculating at any other
college. So he continued to support himself by teaching,
studying early and late, meanwhile, upon his Latin and
Greek, until 1855, when he entered Tufts as a Junior. Two
years later he graduated as Valedictorian of the first class to
receive degrees from the college.</p>
<p> Before completing his college course he obtained a position
as teacher in Arlington, which he was allowed to hold while
still continuing his work at the Hill. After teaching in
Arlington for three years he was appointed to the principalship of Clinton Liberal Institute, where he remained until
1864, when he was tendered the professorship of Latin at
Tufts. Since then he has been actively engaged at the college, not only in the work of his department, but also as
Secretary of the Faculty until 1894, and since that time as
Registrar. He performed the functions of the latter office
for many years prior to its formal creation, acting also as
assistant to the college Treasurer until the appointment of
Rev. W. A. Start as Bursar in 1895.</p>


<pb n="116" id="p.116"/>
<p> Professor Dearborn was married, March 24, 1858. In
1878 he spent several months in travelling with his wife
through England, France, Germany, and Italy, and made
quite an extensive collection of Roman photographs and
relics, with which he often entertains his classes in Roman
antiquities.</p>
<p> Professor Dearborn has recently founded a scholarship
known as the Scholarship of the Class of 1857, for the benefit of women students. He is devoted to his Alma Mater,
and has always labored earnestly for her welfare.</p>

<head>WILLIAM R. SHIPMAN, A.M., D. D.</head>

<p> WILLIAM ROLLIN SHIPMAN was born in Granville,
     Vermont, May 4, 1836. Three years later his
father, who was a farmer, removed to Royalton in the same
State, where he resided for nearly forty years. The boy was
encouraged in his early liking for school, and his later desire
for a college education. He was willingly spared from the
farm to study at the academy of the town, where he soon
became a pupil-assistant, and by teaching in the district
schools in the Winter was able to support himself during the
time of preparation for college. Entering Middlebury College in 1855, he was graduated with distinction in 1859.
He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity,
and also became connected with the local lodge of Masons.</p>
<p> On graduating he took charge of the Green Mountain
Institute at South Woodstock, Vermont. This school was
just then in a very low condition, but four years of arduous
teaching and administrative work on the part of Mr. Shipman
restored in a large measure its old prosperity. It became
evident to him, however, that only an endowed and <pb n="117" id="p.117"/>thoroughly equipped school could meet the growing educational
requirements of Vermont, and he especially desired that
one under the control of the Universalist denomination
should be the equal of any in the State. Accordingly he
took an active part in the movement which led to the founding of Goddard Seminary, and resigning his principalship
entered upon the endless task of raising money by general
subscription for establishing and maintaining such a school
as was projected. Before the end of a year he left this work
to other hands to accept the chair of Rhetoric, Logic, and
English Literature at Tufts, believing that he could continue
to render no less important service to the school. For the
last twenty years he has been President of its Board of
Trustees, Chairman of its Executive Committee, and a self-appointed financial agent, whose compensation has always
consisted in taking a high place on the subscription list.</p>
<p> During the early years of his connection with the college,
Professor Shipman has taught various subjects besides those
covered by his professorship. Metaphysics was included
from the first, although not formally added until the transfer
of English Literature to Professor Maulsby in 1891. He has
held the chair of Rhetoric longer than any other professor
in New England; but although a teacher of so many years'
standing he has always kept abreast of the times. In 1865
he was ordained as a minister, and in addition to his college
work has preached very frequently, although he has never
made a pastoral settlement.</p>
<p> He was married, July 28, 1868, to Miss Martha F. Willis,
daughter of the Rev. John F. Willis. Two sons were born
to them, the elder of whom died at an early age. Mrs.
Shipman died July 2, 1894.</p>
<p> Professor Shipman received the degree of A. M. from
Middlebury College in 1862, and twenty years later Saint
Lawrence University conferred upon him that of D. D. He
was a charter member of the Delta Chapter of Massachusetts


<pb n="118" id="p.118"/>.

of Phi Beta Kappa, and is a member of the New England
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools. Dreading
ostentation, his work has always been quiet, but none the
less effective; and there is no one whose sympathy with the
students is keener or more active. He is a severe but kindly
critic, full of helpful suggestions, and always ready to give
his time for consultation. A word of praise from him is
highly valued, for it is never spoken lightly.</p>

BENJAMIN GRAVES BROWN was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts, February 22, 1837. He attended the
common schools of his native town, and later spent one year
at the Marblehead Academy. The boy had not progressed
very far in the elements of knowledge before he made up his
mind to have a college education. An exceptional opportunity was offered him for preparation, as Latin, Greek, and
several other branches required for admission to college had
just been introduced into the grammar school. In 1854,
at the age of seventeen, he entered Harvard College. While
there he joined the Zeta Psi Fraternity, and was also a
member of the Sophomore Society, being its librarian during
his Junior year.</p>
<p> In the November following his graduation in 1858, he was
elected Principal of the Marblehead Academy, which position he occupied for three years. At the end of this time he
decided to abandon teaching and begin the study of Medicine,
but this plan was suddenly changed by a call to Tufts, which
he received through Professor Marshall, in whose hands the
management of the college had been placed after the death
of President Ballou. Mr. Brown came to the Hill in 1861
as Tutor to the Freshmen and Sophomores in Mathematics
and to the Juniors in Mechanics and Physics. After taking
up his work at Tufts, he pursued a two years course of study
at the Lawrence Scientific School in Cambridge. He received
the degree of A. M. from Tufts in 1865.</p>
<p> Mr. Brown was married, February 12, 1863, to Miss
Rosalia Glenton, and they now have two children, - a son,
who graduated from Tufts in 1888, and a daughter, now the

<pb n="120" id="p.120"/>
wife of Assistant Professor Durkee, who enjoys the distinction of being the first Alumna of the college, having
graduated in 1893.</p>
<p> In 1865, when his three years' appointment as Instructor
had expired, Mr. Brown was elected Walker Professor of
Mathematics. The classes in Physics and Astronomy were
also intrusted to him, and for a time he taught one of the
Latin classes; but when Mr. Dolbear was made Professor of
Physics in 1874, he was relieved of all courses except those
in Mathematics. He is still at the head of this department
in both the Academic and Engineering courses.</p>
<p> With the exception of two years, Professor Brown was a
member of the Somerville School Committee from 1872 to
1889; and he has always taken an active interest in municipal affairs. Unlike so many mathematicians, he has never
been narrowed by his specialty, and his scholarship is comprehensive and thorough. He requires a great deal from his
classes, but is just and fair in his estimation of all work,
and with kind-hearted sympathy is always ready to stretch
out a helping hand to those who stumble on the somewhat
difficult mathematical roadway.</p>

<head>MOSES TRUE BROWN, A. M.</head>

<p>MOSES TRUE BROWN was born in Deerfield, New
Hampshire, on the fourth day of March, 1827. His
early education was obtained at home, where he fitted to
enter the Junior Class of Dartmouth College at the age of
seventeen.  The death of his father, however, obliged him
to relinquish the idea of a college course; and he at once
became a teacher.</p>
<p> At the age of twenty-two he was elected Principal of a
grammar school in Manchester, New Hampshire. From

<pb n="121" id="p.121"/>
there he was called to the principalship of the High School
at New Britain, Connecticut, and thence to the superintendency of the public schools of Toledo, Ohio.</p>
<p> While at Toledo he was married, on July 9, 1863, to Miss
Cora Barney, of Sandusky, and not long afterward accepted
the position of literary critic in the publishing house of Sargent, Willson &#x0026; Hinkle at Cincinnati.</p>
<p> In 1866 Mr. Brown was called to the chair of Oratory at
Tufts, and began his work at the Hill in September of the
same year.</p>
<p> During his term of service at Tufts, which lasted until
October, 1890, Professor Brown was very popular among the
students, and he made the standard of his department
extremely high. The number of exceptionally fine speakers
who appeared in the annual prize contests during his professorship bore witness to his teaching ability. In 1867 the
college conferred upon him the degree of A. M.</p>
<p> While still at Tufts, Professor Brown was, from 1870 to
1874, teacher of elocution in the Boston public schools, a
position in which he succeeded Lewis B. Monroe. In 1884
he opened the Boston School of Oratory, and it was in order
to devote his entire energies to this that he resigned his
position at Tufts in 1890. He was at once elected Professor
Emeritus, Professor Maulsby assuming the active position.</p>
<p> After making a notable success of the School of Oratory,
Professor Brown decided, in 1894, to abandon it and go to
the West, which he did, taking up his residence in Sandusky,
the former home of his wife. There he is very successful
giving various courses independently at different institutions, -a line of work for which extensive experience in
Teachers' Institute courses in Maine, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, and Ohio has eminently fitted him.</p>
<p> Professor Brown is the author of an able work entitled
"The Synthetic Philosophy of Expression." He is President of the Joe Jefferson Dramatic Club of Sandusky,

<pb n="122" id="p.122"/>

and has been prominent in the Central, Shakespeare, and
Metaphysical Clubs of Boston, the New Hampshire Club,
and several other organizations of a social and literary character. For many years, during his residence in Boston, he
was wont to read Dickens's "Christmas Carol" before the
Boston Young Men's Christian Union, an institution which
he also often favored with lectures.</p>

CHARLES DARLIN BRAY was born in Valley Falls,
Rhode Island, March 15, 1844, and attended the public
schools of that town. He early manifested a liking for
mechanical pursuits, and his father, who was an expert
mechanic in charge of the machine shops connected with the
village factories, took pains to foster these tendencies in his
son by familiarizing him with the various parts of the
machines. Opportunities for this sort of practical education
were increased about the time the boy was ready to enter the
grammar school, the father then being employed in the
Thurston and Lane Engine Works, of Providence.</p>
<p> After graduating from the grammar school he was sent to
a commercial academy for a course in book-keeping, after
which he spent the summer in the drafting room of the
Providence Steam Engine Company, and then entered the
Lonsdale High School to prepare for the engineering course
at Brown University.</p>
<p> In the summer of 1861 he enlisted in the Ninth Regiment,
R. I. Volunteers, an emergency regiment composed of boys
from sixteen to eighteen years of age, on seeing which President Lincoln asked Governor Sprague if they had brought
their cradles with them. He entered the university in the
Fall, and graduated after a two years' course, having assisted
in the observatory and instructed students in the use of
instruments and methods of recording during the latter part
of his course.</p>
<p> He refused the simultaneous offers of an instructorship at
Brown and one in the Providence public schools to accept a
position with the Providence Steam Engine Company, which

<pb n="124" id="p.124"/>

was then building marine engines for the navy. He resigned
this position after three years for that of Assistant Engineer
on a Pennsylvania railroad contract. He returned to his
old position in Providence in 1866, but resigned again soon
after to accept an appointment as Third Acting Assistant
Engineer of the United States Navy. After a course of
instruction at Annapolis he was assigned to the North Pacific
Squadron. He left the Navy a year later, and in 1869
received the appointment of Instructor of Engineering at
Tufts, where he subsequently became Professor of Civil and
Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p> In 1870 Professor Bray was married to Miss Josephine
Compton, whom he had first met at Annapolis. They now
have four daughters and one son.</p>
<p> Professor Bray is a member of all the leading engineering
societies of the country. Brown University gave him an
A. M. in 1873. He is a vestryman and very active member
of the St. James Protestant Episcopal Church at North
Cambridge, but resides at the Hill.</p>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="CHARLES E. FAY, A. M." id="c4s14">
<head>CHARLES E. FAY, A. M.</head>

<p>CHARLES E. FAY was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts,
on the tenth of March, 1846. His father, the Rev.
Cyrus H. Fay, was then pastor of the Universalist Church in
Roxbury, his mother was a native of Tavistock, England.
She died when he was only four years old, and his childhood
was passed partly at the home of his grandparents in Concord,
N.H., and partly with his father.</p>
<p> His education began at an early period, as he entered a
private school in New York City at the age of four. Owing
to the alternation between one home and the other, his

<pb n="125" id="p.125"/>

school life was considerably varied. When six years old he
was a pupil at Pembroke Academy, New Hampshire, under
the guardianship of his aunts, who were likewise pupils
there. Between the ages of eleven and sixteen he was a
member of the high schools at Concord, New Hampshire,
Middletown, Conn., and Providence, Rhode Island, from the
last of which he graduated. This school was then regarded
as one of the best in New England.</p>
<p> Although this securing of a secondary education at various
schools necessarily interfered with the unity of his course
and delayed its completion, it had, nevertheless, many
advantages, and Professor Fay himself is convinced that his
experience of the world was in this way rendered the fuller,
and that on the whole he was a gainer rather than a loser by
the process. He was the youngest member of most of his
classes, and a fondness for mischief was as characteristic of
him as his readiness in learning. The latter enabled him to
always maintain a position at or very near the head of the
class.</p>
<p> A few months after his graduation he was offered the position of teacher at a district school in Nashua, New Hampshire. Following the advice of his father, he accepted the
position, and his career as a teacher began.</p>
<p> At the close of a term of seventeen weeks here he returned
to his home in Providence, and shortly after became Master
of the Middle District Grammar School in Bristol, Rhode
Island, where he taught for somewhat more than a year.
This sojourn in Bristol was perhaps the critical point in his
life. Here he made the acquaintance of Mr. Joshua Kendall,
who was at that time Principal of the Rhode Island State
Normal School. Constant intercourse with this scholarly
man led Mr. Fay to reconsider a former determination not
to take a college course, and under Mr. Kendall's instruction he began the study of C&#x00E6;sar.</p>
<p> In consideration of his fondness for out-of-door life, <pb n="126" id="p.126"/>particularly among the mountains, it may be interesting to note
that it was during this year that, with a small company of
his fellow-teachers, he made his first visit to the White
Mountains, and camped out among them for three weeks.</p>
<p> He gave up his school in Bristol in 1864, and turned his
attention wholly to preparation for college. He decided to
come to Tufts, and entered in the Fall of 1865.</p>
<p> Since a large number of the regular college requirements
had been previously covered by him, he was able to gain one
year in his course and to graduate in 1868, when he at once
received the appointment of Walker Special Instructor in
Mathematics. Literature and the languages, however, had
appealed to his tastes far more than mathematics, and had
received the best of his efforts, and the ministry seemed
destined to furnish his life-work. In addition to his work
as Instructor at the college he supplied the pulpit of what
was then the Allen Street Unitarian Church at North
Cambridge.</p>
<p> In the Summer of 1869 the new professorship of French
and German was offered him with leave of absence for one
year in Europe. This year was spent in travel and study in
France, Germany, and Italy, and in the next Autumn he
took up the work of organizing his department. During his
stay in Europe he met in Florence Miss Mary W. Lincoln, of
Boston, to whom he was married after their return from
abroad.  They have three children, -a son and two
daughters.</p>
<p> It is unnecessary to trace here what he has done in raising
the Department of Modern Languages to its present high
standing. Notwithstanding the large amount of labor that
devolves upon him, his work is not confined to the classroom. He has always been one of the foremost promoters
of the cause of the Modern Languages, and a few years ago
wrote a pamphlet on the subject, which attracted much
attention. He is in demand as an essayist and a lecturer,

<pb n="127" id="p.127"/>
and is also very well known through his connection with
the Appalachian Mountain Club. He has been the editor of
that society's publications since their beginning. He was
President of the Club for some time, and is an enthusiastic
member of the snow-shoe section. During the Summer of
1895 he conducted a large party of tourists over the Selkirk
Range of the Rockies.</p>
<p> Professor Fay is a member of the "Round Table," and of
the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory
Schools. He was one of the organizing members of the local
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, and also belongs to the Theta
Delta Chi Fraternity.</p>

<head>AMOS E. DOLBEAR, M. E., PH. D.</head>

<p>AMOS EMERSON DOLBEAR was born November 10,
1837, at Norwich, Connecticut, in the house noted for
having been the birthplace of Benedict Arnold. When he
was only two years old his father died, and soon afterwards
he was taken by his mother to Newport, Rhode Island, where
he made the most of his opportunities in the public schools
until his mother's death, which occurred when he was ten
years old.</p>
<p> Soon afterward a friend of his mother, acting as his guardian, sent him to live on a farm in New Hampshire. The
monotony of his hard and cheerless life here was varied by
employment in a ship-yard and in a printing-office. During
this time he managed to eke out a meagre education in the
district school, where at this early age he evinced the rare
intellectual endowments which have since rendered him
famous. He took a keen interest in free-hand drawing,
geology, and mineralogy. He also began the study of
astronomy at this time, but without the aid of teacher or
text-book. He had heard that there were constellations in
the skies, and several of these he managed to make out by
tracing the positions of prominent stars.</p>
<p> His early training, therefore, was admirably calculated to
develop those observant faculties which are so essential in
the study of the natural sciences.</p>
<p> When he became old enough his guardian desired that
Amos should learn a trade, and he was sent to Worcester,
Massachusetts, where he entered the employ of Allen  &#x0026; 
Thurber, makers of pistols, where he remained until he
became a journeyman.

inflamed by the glowing accounts of the West; and, led on
by his desire to see the new country, he joined the stream
of emigrants which was constantly pouring towards the
setting sun.</p>
<p> Failing to get employment among his friends in Wisconsin
he resolved to go to Missouri, where he had other acquaintances. Here he found employment on a farm, and finally
secured the position of school-teacher in the town of Hartwell,
Missouri. He began his first term with every promise of
success, but unfortunately he incurred the ill-will of some
of the rough characters in the neighborhood by punishing
two of his pupils for misdemeanors. He was mobbed on two
different occasions, being set upon by men with pistols and
bowie-knives. He met them with the same weapons, and,
by a remarkable exhibition of bravery, succeeded in cowing
the ringleaders and driving the mob away.</p>
<p> After this he decided to leave Missouri, and started for
the East with his pack upon his back, and but a few dollars
in his pocket.</p>
<p> He walked over four hundred miles, supporting himself on
the way by his skill with the violin and flute. When he
reached Egypt, Illinois, he stopped awhile to earn money by
painting houses. From there he took the steamboat up the
Ohio, and on landing, came by rail to Newport, Rhode
Island.</p>
<p> He at once began to look around for work, and soon got
employment at Taunton, Massachusetts. He desired to learn
the machinist's trade, and made rapid advances, but had to
give up work on account of ill-health. After becoming
stronger he again sought employment, and found it in the
Springfield armory, but soon broke down again. He finally
made up his mind that his life-work must be of a different
character, and determined to acquire a better education, and
become a teacher.</p>
<pb n="130" id="p.130"/>
<p> His schooling up to this time had been very limited. He
had attended the public school at Newport, and later a New
Hampshire district school. He had picked up a fair knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, and physical science, by
working on his books after shop hours. With this meagre
preparation, and no friend or relative upon whom he could
rely for aid, he went to Delaware, Ohio, to attend the Ohio
Wesleyan University. By intense application, he made
rapid progress in his studies, showing such aptitude in
Physics and Chemistry that he was made an Assistant in
those departments.</p>
<p> He graduated in 1866, having actually spent less than two
years upon his course, and having supported himself entirely
by his own exertions during this time.</p>
<p> After graduation he went to Michigan University to study
Chemistry, and in six weeks he was appointed Assistant
Instructor in that department. At the end of the year he
was placed at the head of a geological exploring expedition
destined for the district around Lake Superior, and upon his
return the University conferred on him the degrees of A. M.
and M.E.</p>
<p> He at once entered upon the duties of his profession, and
became Assistant Professor of Natural History in Kentucky
University. The chair of Natural History was offered him
at the end of a year, but he decided to accept a call from
Bethany College, and became Professor of Physics and
Chemistry in that institution, in 1868. He served as Mayor
of the city of Bethany, West Virginia, in 1871-72. He
accepted the chair of Physics and Astronomy at Tufts
College in 1874.</p>
<p> Professor Dolbear began to display his inventive faculties
at an early age, and wrestled with the illusion of "perpetual motion" with ingenious results. While working as a
mechanic, and during his college course, he patented several
inventions, but not until his experiments in telephony

<pb n="131" id="p.131"/>
were made public did the world hear much of him as an
inventor.</p>
<p> He began the study of the convertibility of sound into
electricity in 1873, and in 1876 he perfected and patented
his magneto-electric telephone. In 1879 he made other
discoveries in telephony, and invented the static telephone.</p>
<p> Some of his other valuable contributions to science are
his magneto-electric telegraph; the electric gyroscope used
to demonstrate the rotation of the earth; tuning forks for
the illustration of Lissajous' curves; the opeidoscope for the
illustration of vocal vibrations; and a new system of
incandescent lighting.</p>
<p> His contributions to the scientific press have been numerous, and aside from their authority, they are characterized
by a simplicity and clearness of style which recommends
them at once to the reader. He is the author of several
standard scientific works, - "A Handbook of Chemical
Analysis," "A Treatise on Projections," "A Manual of
Experiments in Physics, Chemistry, and Natural History,"
"The Telephone," and "Matter, Ether, and Motion." He
has published several pamphlets on the speaking telephone,
and has been an active contributor to scientific journals.</p>
<p> He has, besides, given addresses before scientific bodies both
in this country and abroad. He is a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the
Twentieth Century Club.</p>
<p> From the Paris Exposition he received a silver medal for
his contributions to science, and also a gold medal from the
Crystal Palace exhibition at London, in 1882. Both at the
Electrical Exhibition in Philadelphia and at the World's
Fair, he was one of the examiners.</p>
<p>  Professor Dolbear was married, in August, 1869, to Miss
 Alice J. Hood. They have had six children, of whom three
 sons and two daughters are living.</p>

          <head>STEPHEN MINOT PITMAN, M. E.</head>

<p>STEPHEN MINOT PITMAN was born in Boston, Massachusetts, July 19, 1850. He received his preparatory
education in the High School of Providence, Rhode Island,
and entered Brown University in 1866. After spending one
year there he came to Tufts, from which he graduated in
1869 with the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy. While in
college he became a member of the Theta Delta Fraternity.</p>
<p> After graduating from Tufts, Mr. Pitman studied for four
years at the School of Mining at Harvard University, receiving the degree of Mining Engineer. He then spent one year
in study at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin. In
1874 he returned to Tufts as assistant in Chemistry and
Walker Special Instructor in Mathematics. The next year
he became Instructor in Chemistry, and when his term as
Walker Special Instructor had expired he took charge of the
chemical department with the title of Professor.</p>
<p> In teaching Professor Pitman was very successful, his
work being of a thorough and practical kind; but in 1882
he decided to resign his professorship in order to accept the
position of Treasurer and Manager of the Bell Silver and
Copper Mining Company at Butte, Montana. Having resigned
this position he served as Chemist of the Valley Falls Company at Valley Falls, Rhode Island, for two years, and in
1887 became Superintendent of the Cop Dyeing Company, at
Providence. In 1889 he located in Philadelphia, acting as
Secretary of the Philadelphia Manufacturers' Mutual Fire
Insurance Company, until 1893, and as Vice-President and
General Manager of the Holmes Fibre-Graphite Manufacturing Company, during the years 1893 and 1894. He returned
to Providence to accept the secretaryship of the Narragansett
Mutual Fire Insurance Company, which position he now
holds.</p>

<pb n="133" id="p.133"/>
<p> Professor Pitman was married, October 12, 1878, to Miss
Maud R. Fisher.  She died, and on February 13, 1884, he
married Miss Mary H. Porter.</p>
<p> Professor Pitman was made a member of the American
Institute of Mining Engineers, in 1873, and of the German
Chemical Society, in 1874. He is also a member of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science and
of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He is
active in artistic, social, and athletic affairs, as well as in
those of science. He has been a member of the Boston Art
Club since 1875, and of the Providence Art Club since 1887.
He also belongs to the Da Vinci Club, the Providence
Camera Club, the Philadelphia Photographic Society, the
Squantum Club, the Mankerin Cricket Club, and the Providence Athletic Club.</p>

<head>WILLIAM L. HOOPER, A. M.</head>

<p>WILLIAM   LESLIE HOOPER was born in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, August 2, 1855. His family was a
branch of the Hooper family of Marblehead, Massachusetts.
His father was one of the veteran clergymen of the Universalist denomination, his term of service extending over more
than fifty years. Being the son of a minister, William's
early life was passed in several different places. He entered
the High School of Chatham, Massachusetts, but received his
diploma at that of Gloucester.</p>
<p> After graduation he taught school in Gloucester for some
time, and then entered Tufts College in the class of '77.
During the latter half of his course he devoted himself principally to Physics and Chemistry. In the latter he did
extra work, preparing reagents for the lectures of Professor
Pitman, then at the head of the department.</p>
<p> After receiving his degree of A. B., Mr. Hooper pursued a
graduate course, principally in Physics, and at the same
time assisted Professor Dolbear in his experiments on the
telephone.</p>
<p> In 1878 he received the degree of A. M., and was at once
appointed Instructor in Mathematics and Physical Science
in the Bromfield School at Harvard, Massachusetts. He
was the first instructor to be appointed in this school, and
after teaching there for two years he was made its Principal.</p>
<p> While there he was married, in 1879, to Miss Mary Elizabeth Heard, of Waltham, Massachusetts. They have five
children.</p>
<p> He left the Bromfield School to accept the position of
Assistant Professor of Physics at Tufts in 1883. Soon after

<pb n="135" id="p.135"/>

this the Electrical department was instituted under his
charge, and in 1891 he was appointed Professor of Electrical Engineering. Since that time he has devoted himself
exclusively to electrical work.</p>
<p> Professor Hooper has been honored by election to fellowship in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the
members of which are drawn largely from Harvard University. He has contributed numerous scientific articles to
the Electrical Journals, and has often been employed as an
electrical expert. In this capacity he has served the West
End Street Railway Company at various times, especially
during the development of electric traction. He has been
a Director of the Somerville Electric Light Company for
a number of years, and is at present employed by several
different companies as Consulting Engineer.</p>
<p> He is a member of the Theta Delta Chi Fraternity and of
Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p> Professor Hooper has done much toward placing the Electrical department of Tufts in the position which it holds
to-day, and the credit which the work done here reflects upon
him is only a just return for what his reputation among
experts has done for the department.</p>

<p>ARTHUR MESSINGER COMEY was born in Boston,
      November 10, 1861. He received his early education
in the schools of Quincy, Massachusetts, and prepared for
college at Adams Academy. In 1878 he entered Harvard,
graduating with honors four years later.</p>
<p> His principal work at Cambridge had been in the department of chemistry, and after his graduation he spent nearly

<pb n="136" id="p.136"/>
a year at Tufts as assistant to Professor Michael. In August,
1883, he sailed for Europe and studied for a time at the
Polytechnikum  in Zurich.  Forced by illness to give up
study for a time, he went to Nice for rest and recuperation.
Early in the following spring he went to Heidelberg, where
he studied for a year with Professor Bunsen, taking the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, in February, 1885. Dr.
Comey's diploma was the last to be sealed with the original
seal of the University.</p>
<p> Returning to this country, Dr. Comey was at once appointed
Professor pro tem, and later regular Professor in the University of Vermont, but he soon resigned this position to
accept an instructorship at Harvard. There he had charge
of the Chemical department of the summer school for four
years. In the summer of 1889 he was appointed to the
chair of Chemistry in Tufts College, and accepted the position, serving until 1894, when he resigned to pursue special
investigation in a laboratory in Cambridge.</p>
<p> Dr. Comey has contributed many articles to the "Berichte
der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft," the "American
Chemical Journal," and "The Proceedings of the American
Academy." He has also compiled a dictionary of chemical
solubilities for the Smithsonian Institute. He was made a
member of the German Chemical Society in 1883, and a
Fellow of the American Academy in 1890.

<head>DAVID L. MAULSBY, A.M.</head>

<p>DAVID LEE MAULSBY was born in Baltimore, Maryland, January 30, 1859. When about twelve years of
age he entered the Baltimore High School, but left it at the
end of two years to enter business. From 1873 to 1879 he
was employed, first as clerk and then as bookkeeper, in his
native city.</p>
<p> In the Fall of 1879 he entered Tufts Divinity School, but
after spending two years there and preaching for one summer
vacation, he came to the conclusion that the ministry was
not his vocation, and set about fitting himself for the College
of Letters. This he accomplished in two years, during a
part of which time he was occupied in business. After his
day's work, he was accustomed to meet Oscar H. Perry, '83,
in Middle Hall and spend the evening reading Latin. He
entered Tufts in the Fall of 1883, and was graduated in 1887.</p>
<p> Several offices fell to his lot during his college course,
among them the presidency of his class, and of the Mathetican Society, and the Editor-in-chiefship of the "Tuftonian. "
He was also Class Poet, and wrote a commencement part, on
"Why study the Classics ? " He won the Latin Prose Prize,
one second and one first Rhetorical Prize, and the Goddard
Prize Scholarship in Oratory. While in college he joined
the Zeta Psi Fraternity.</p>
<p> Immediately upon graduating from college, Mr. Maulsby
was tendered the position of Principal of Goddard Seminary,
Barre, Vermont, which he accepted, serving until March,
1891, when he was called to the chair of English Literature
and Oratory at Tufts.</p>

<pb n="138" id="p.138"/>

<p> On July 9, 1889, he was married to Miss Lillian Frances Ayer, of Somerville, Massachusetts.  They have two
children.</p>
<p> In 1892 Professor Maulsby received the degree of A. M.
from his Alma Mater. For three years, ending in November,
1895, he was the custodian of the Faculty records, first as
Clerk and then as Secretary.</p>
<p> In addition to his work at the college he has lectured upon
English Literature at the Boston College of Oratory, and has
contributed prose and verse to various publications. He is
the author of the words of the immortal " Brown and Blue."</p>
<p> The reproduction of "Ralph Roister Doister" in June,
1895, was a triumph for Professor Maulsby and for the
college. He spared himself no labor which might contribute
to the success of the piece, and the work done by the student
actors reflected great credit on their Instructor.</p>
<p> Professor Maulsby was one of the organization members of
the local chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. He is also a member
of the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory
Schools, and takes an active interest in all educational
questions of the day.</p>

<head>J. STERLING KINGSLEY, S. D.</head>

<p>JOHN STERLING KINGSLEY was born in Cincinnatus,
New York, April 7, 1854. His father, who was then
County Judge and Surrogate, moved to Norwich for professional reasons two years after the birth of his son. Here
the boy grew up, gaining his early education at private
schools. From his earliest years he was intensely interested
in scientific subjects; chemistry soon becoming his favorite
study.</p>
<p> After attending the academies at Norwich and Cincinnatus

<pb n="139" id="p.139"/>

for some time, he took up special studies in engineering.
He refused an appointment to the United States Naval
Academy at Annapolis, and entered the Brooklyn Polytechnic
Institute. The death of his father forced him to leave the
Institute without completing his course; but his engineering
training now stood him in good stead, for after a year and a
half of steady work in this line he was enabled to resume his
studies, and entered the Junior Class of Williams College
in the Fall of 1873. About this time he became strongly
attracted to the study of medicine, and devoted much time
to it while pursuing the regular college work.</p>
<p> His connection with the Natural History Society of the
college, however, caused him to decide upon biology as his
life study; and upon his graduation in 1875 he went to the
Peabody Academy of Science at Salem, Massachusetts, where
he studied with Dr. A. S. Packard, now at Brown University.
Here his work was entirely in the line of systematic zoology,
especially in the group of Crustacea, with regard to which
he published a number of papers.</p>
<p> In 1878 he was located at Providence, Rhode Island, as
an assistant on the United States Entomological Commission;
and the following year he went to the Philadelphia Academy
of Natural Science, where he took up the study of general
morphology.</p>
<p> During this time he supported himself by drawing scientific
illustrations and by writing articles for compensation whenever he had the opportunity.</p>
<p> He first became generally known through his work on the
"Standard Natural History," in editing which he was engaged
from 1882 to 1885. At the same time he was studying under
the direction of the Princeton Faculty, and in 1885 he received
his Doctorate of Science from the College of New Jersey.</p>
<p> In 1886 Dr. Kingsley became editor of the "American
Naturalist," - a position which he still holds. For the next
two years he was at the University of Indiana as Professor

<pb n="140" id="p.140"/>
of Zoology, leaving that place to accept the chair of Biology
at the University of Nebraska. In 1891 he resigned this
position to study for a year in Europe, chiefly at Frieburg
under Robert Wiedersheim.</p>
<p> Soon after his return from Europe in 1892, Dr. Kingsley
was tendered the chair of Biology at Tufts. He at once
accepted the position, and has since been untiring in his
endeavors for the advancement of his department. He found
it with very insufficient laboratory facilities; but the new
wing of the Museum, designed under his direction, could
scarcely be improved. His dominant characteristic may be
said to be the ability to impart his own enthusiasm to all
those connected with his department.</p>
<p> Professor Kingsley has been a prolific writer in the
scientific field. Since coming to Tufts he has, among other
things, written nearly all the biological articles for the new
edition of Johnson's Cyclop&#x00E6;dia.</p>
<p> Dr. Kinsgley was married, January 31, 1882, to Miss
Mary Emma Reed, of Salem, and they have one daughter.</p>

FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES was born in Brooklyn,
New York, July 23, 1869. His parents were from
Massachusetts, his father being a graduate of Harvard College. His mother is a sister of Mrs. W. G. Tousey. He
attended the public schools until he was fifteen years of
age, when he entered the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute
with the intention of finishing his preparation for college
in three years. Being dissatisfied with the slow progress
of his class, however, he left at the end of the second year,
and having completed his preparation during the summer,
entered Columbia College in the Fall of 1886.</p>
<p> At college he made a specialty of the classics, and received
the highest prize in Latin in his Junior year. During his
Senior year he acted as Instructor in Greek in the Drisler
School, New York City, teaching twenty-five hours each
week, while carrying a college programme of sixteen hours.
In 1890 he received the degree of A. B., with highest honors
in Latin and Greek.</p>
<p> Upon his graduation he was at once offered an instructorship in Latin or Greek at Columbia, but he at first declined,
expecting to study law with his father. It required but one
month in the office, however, to convince him that the law
was not his vocation, and influenced by the success which
had attended his teaching in the previous year, he accepted a
second offer from his Alma Mater of an instructorship in
Greek. He had charge of the Freshman class and of the
classes in sight-reading for one year, at the end of which
time he resigned to accept the offer of an instructorship at
Tufts. He began his work at the Hill in the Fall of 1891,

<pb n="142" id="p.142"/>
and soon almost all the courses in Greek were placed in his
charge. In 1892 he was made Assistant Professor of Greek,
and in 1893, Professor of Classical Philology. His success
in the department has been of the highest order, the result
of tact combined with great personal magnetism.</p>
<p> Professor Graves received the degree of A. M. from
Columbia in 1891, and that of Ph. D. from Boston University
in the following year. He is the author of several books,
among which may be mentioned "The Burial Customs of
the Ancient Greeks," published in 1891, "The Philoctetes
of Sophocles," published in 1893, and a "First Book in
Greek," edited in conjunction with Dr. Hawes of Brooklyn,
in 1895. He has also contributed many articles to different
reviews and philological journals, and to the International
Cyclop&#x00E6;dia. He is a member of the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools and of the American Philological Association, and was one of the founders
of the Delta chapter of Massachusetts of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p> Dr. Graves was married, December 18, 1895, to Miss
Helen Hope Wadsworth, of Malden, Massachusetts, a graduate
of Boston University in the class of ninety-one.</p>

<head>GARDNER C. ANTHONY, A. M.</head>

<p>GARDNER CHASE ANTHONY was born in Providence, Rhode Island, April 24, 1856, his ancestors
having settled in the colony under Roger Williams.</p>
<p> He began to attend school at the age of five years, and
three years later entered the English and Classical School of
Providence, where he remained for nearly nine years, leaving a few months before graduation on account of illness.
In October, 1874, he entered the drafting room of the Providence Steam Engine Company, where he remained for <pb n="143" id="p.143"/>something more than a year, in the meanwhile preparing himself
for Brown University, which he entered during the Winter
of 1875-76. Here he followed the engineering course for a
year, leaving in the Fall of 1877 to pursue special studies at
Tufts.</p>
<p> In 1878 he entered the drafting-room of the Harris-Corliss
Engine Works, where he remained nearly three years.</p>
<p> While here he was married, June 25, 1879, to Miss Susie
A. Pearson, daughter of Mr. Samuel Pearson, of Boston.
One son has been born to them.</p>
<p> In the Summer of 1881, Mr. Anthony returned to the
employ of the Providence Steam Engine Company, where he
remained until November, 1884. During the year following
he was engaged on patent work, general engineering, and as
designer for the Brown &#x0026; Sharpe Manufacturing Company.</p>
<p> Mr. Anthony began to teach in 1885, his first position
being in the Rhode Island School of Design, where he was
soon appointed Director of the Mechanical Department. In
connection with this position he also accepted that of
Teacher of Drawing in the Providence High School, which
he continued to fill for six years.</p>
<p> In 1887 he founded the Rhode Island Technical Drawing
School, which enjoyed great prosperity under his management. In 1889 he received still another addition to his
labors in the principalship of the Pawtucket Evening Drawing School, which position, together with the former, he
filled until 1893, when he was called to Tufts as Dean of
the Bromfield-Pearson School and Professor of Technical
Drawing in the college.</p>
<p> Professor Anthony has published a set of text books
known as the "Technical Drawing Series," which have been
heartily endorsed by prominent educators, and are now used
in many leading schools and colleges. In 1884 he was
elected a member of the American Society of Engineers, and
in 1890 Tufts conferred upon him the degree of A. M.</p>

<pb n="144" id="p.144"/>
<p> Professor Anthony, by reason of the large amount of
theoretical and practical training which he has received, is
admirably fitted for the position which he has been called
upon to fill at Tufts. He brings into the class-room the
result of actual experience. He has been on the Hill but a
short time, but has already become a favorite with the
students, both as an instructor and as a man.</p>

<p>ARTHUR MICHAEL was born in Buffalo, New York,
August 7, 1853, and received his preliminary education largely in private schools.</p>
<p> On account of ill health he went to Germany in August,
1870, where, after recovering from a severe attack of brain
fever, he matriculated at the University of Berlin, making
Chemistry his principal work. After one year of study here
he spent two years at Heidelberg, and then returned to
Berlin, where he remained for four years more. While in
Germany he enjoyed the instruction of such master scientists
as Robert Bunsen, Hoffman, and Helmholtz, and attended
the lectures of Kirschoff, Dobe, and others of equal note.
In 1879 he went to Paris, where he attended the &#x00E9;cole
de M&#x00E9;decine for one year, and also studied in the laboratory
of A. D. Wurtz.</p>
<p> Returning to America he was appointed Assistant in the
Chemical Laboratory at Tufts in 1881, and a year later was
chosen Professor of Chemistry to fill the vacancy caused by
the resignation of Professor Pitman. He occupied the chair
of Chemistry for eight years, and during that time made the
laboratory at Tufts famous as the seat of notable research
work. He received the degree of A. M. from Tufts in 1882,
and that of Ph. D. in 1890.</p>
<p> In 1888 Professor Michael was offered the position of
Chief Chemist at Clark University. At first he refused the
offer, but in 1890 decided to accept it.</p>
<p> Professor Michael married Miss Helen Abbot, and in 1889
they started on a tour around the world, spending eighteen
months in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Dr. Michael is an
<pb n="146" id="p.146"/>
enthusiastic mountaineer, and has ascended the Matterhorn
and several other Alpine peaks.</p>
<p> Returning to this country in 1890, he occupied the position
at Clark University for a few months, after which he went
to the Isle of Wight, where he established a private laboratory, and spent his time in original research for four years.
In the Spring of 1894 he was invited to resume his former
position at Tufts, and in the Fall he took up his work in the
new chemical laboratory, where he devotes himself entirely
to the graduate department.</p>
<p> Dr. Michael is a member of the National Academy of

<head>LEO R. LEWIS, A. M.</head>

<p> LEO RICH LEWIS was born in Woodstock, Vermont,
February 11, 1865. At that time his father, the Rev.
J. J. Lewis, was Principal of the Green Mountain Liberal
Institute, but in 1867 moved with his family to South Boston,
where he resided until 1893. His son received an exceptionally thorough preparatory education in the Boston
schools, graduating from the Lincoln Grammar School in
1876, from the English High School in 1879, and from the
Latin School in 1883. In the Fall of '83 he entered Tufts,
and graduated in 1887.</p>
<p>  While in college Mr. Lewis played for one season on the
base-ball team, and was Exchange Editor of the " Tuftonian "


<pb n="147" id="p.147"/>

for one year. He was very active in the re-organization of
the Glee Club, which gave its first concert in the old Chapel
in Ballou Hall in the Spring of 1886. He took the Freshmen Mathematical Prize, one first and one second Rhetorical
Prize, and was Class Orator.</p>
<p> After his graduation from Tufts, Mr. Lewis studied for
two years at Harvard, taking first the degree of A. B., and
then that of A. M. with highest honors in Music. While at
Harvard he composed a piece for a male chorus and orchestra,
which was given by the Harvard Glee Club and Pierian
Sodality. His thesis, for a string quartette, was also performed. In July, 1889, he sailed for Europe, and after
travelling for some time on the Continent settled in Munich,
where he remained until August, 1892, studying Music and
the Languages. While established at Munich he made several continental excursions, including one to Italy and three
to Paris. On July 15, 1892, he received a diploma from the
School of Music at Munich, with Honorable Mention in
Composition.</p>
<p> Immediately upon his return from abroad Mr. Lewis
began work at Tufts, where he had received the appointment
of Instructor in French.</p>
<p> On December 21, 1892, he was married to Miss Carrie
Nichols Bullard, daughter of Mr. Gardner W. Bullard, of
Brookline, Massachusetts. Their baby boy came into the
world on Commencement Day, 1895.</p>
<p> Music has always been Mr. Lewis's engrossing interest.
During his college course he was the leading spirit in the
Glee Club, and since his return to the Hill he has devoted
himself energetically to its training. The results of his
labors the public has seen in the fine work of the club during
the past three years. He has also written and arranged
several selections for the club, his name being especially
identified with the "P. T. Barnum Song" and "Charlie's
Light."  While still in college he published a few songs and


<pb n="148" id="p.148"/>
hymns, and several operettas and short cantatas for children.
While in Munich he edited the Zeta Psi Song Book, published
in January, 1891. Since his return to this country he has
published a sonata for violin and piano, and a short cantata
entitled "The Consolation of Music." He edited numbers
1 and 2 of the "National School Library of Song," and
was Musical Editor of "Church Harmonies New and Old,"
published in 1895.</p>
<p> In the Summer of 1895 the chair of the History and
Theory of Music was instituted at Tufts, and was at once
offered to Mr. Lewis. He is giving two courses in that
department during the present year, while still retaining
charge of a large part of the work in French.</p>
<p> Professor Lewis was one of the organizers of the Twentieth
Century Club, and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>

<p>FRANK WILLIAMS DURKEE was born October 5, 1861,
at North Tunbridge, Orange County, Vermont. Mr.
Durkee's paternal ancestors were from Connecticut. His
great-great-grandfather, John Durkee, was a captain in the
Revolutionary Army, having command of the forts at New
London. After relinquishing his command John Durkee
removed to Vermont, settling upon an estate which still
remains in the possession of the Durkee family.</p>
<p> Professor Durkee's boyhood was spent, as that of many a
farmer's son has been, attending the district school in
winter, and working on the farm during the summer months.
At the age of fifteen he entered the State Normal School at
Randolph, but being desirous of entering college he left
this school during his second year there to enter Goddard
Seminary at Barre.</p>
<p> He entered Tufts in the Fall of 1884 as a candidate for the
degree of A. B. Here he rapidly rose to prominence in
athletics, occupying the position of base-ball captain in his
Senior year, and until four years ago was Tufts' " strongest
man." A prominent member of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity, he was an editor on the "Tuftonian," and "'88 Annual,"
and was President of his class in his Senior year.</p>
<p> Graduating in 1888, he returned to Tufts the next year as
a graduate student under Professor Dolbear and Dr. Freer,
receiving the degree of A. M. in 1889. The same year he
was appointed Instructor in Physical Training. The following year he refused a position in the High School at Erie,
New York, to accept the appointment of Instructor in Chemistry and Physical Training at Tufts. Through Mr. Durkee's


<pb n="150" id="p.150"/>
persistent efforts Physical Training has assumed an importance in college work never before known at Tufts, being
advanced to the standard of the work in the other departments. During the year 1893-94, owing to the vacancy in
the chair of Chemistry, Mr. Durkee had full charge of this
department in addition to his duties as Instructor in the
gymnasium. In the Summer of 1895 Mr. Durkee was appointed Assistant Professor in Chemistry, and in the Fall the appointment of Mr. Stroud as Instructor in Athletics
relieved him from his duties in the gymnasium.</p>
<p> Professor Durkee spent the Summer of 1893 in research
work for the Dominion Coal Company, and that of 1894 in the
investigation of mining properties in copper and nickel ores
for Boston parties. As this work has been for other parties,
he has not been at liberty to publish it.</p>
<p> Professor Durkee is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p> On February 21, 1895, he was united in marriage to
Henrietta Noble Brown, daughter of Professor and Mrs.
Benjamin G. Brown, and a little girl was born to them on
New Year's Day, 1896.</p>

<head>FRANK E. SANBORN, S. B.</head>

<p>FRANK E. SANBORN was born in Boston, Massachusetts, August 25, 1866. His ancestors were among
the earliest settlers of Massachusetts, and the family has
always resided in the vicinity of Boston. He attended the
public schools of the city, graduating from the Latin School
in 1885. He passed the examinations for Harvard, but finally
decided to enter the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Here he pursued the course in Mechanical Engineering,
graduating in 1889.</p>
<p> Mr. Sanborn remained at the Institute for one year as

<pb n="151" id="p.151"/>
Assistant in Mechanical Engineering, and then accepted an
instructorship at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.
After teaching there for one year he received the appointment of Walker Special Instructor in Mathematics at Tufts.
When the term of this appointment expired in 1894, he was
made Instructor in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p> Before coming to Tufts Mr. Sanborn gave the college the
benefit of his skill with the pencil by furnishing nearly all
the illustrations for the "Brown and Blue" issued by the
Class of '91. During the Summer of 1892 he was engaged
on special drafting work in the office of Frederick S. Pearson, '83, in connection with the Brooklyn Power Station.
He attended the World's Fair early in the following summer, and then spent the remainder of the season in travelling through the Northwest with Henry B. Stone. Mr.
Sanborn delivered an illustrated lecture entitled "To and
Fro in the White City."</p>
<p> From his earliest years, Mr. Sanborn has been a member
of the Shawmut Universalist Church, -now the "Every-Day Church."  At one time he was President of the Young
People's Christian Union, and he is at present Assistant
Superintendent of the Sunday School and Chairman of the
Standing Committee. He has been, and is, very prominent
in humanitarian work. He was one of the principal initiators of the movement which resulted in the establishment of
a Boys' Club Association by the Universalist young people
of Boston and vicinity. The first club was started under
his presidency during the Winter of 1893-94, on Portland
Street, Boston. He has also done work of the same sort on
behalf of the "Every-Day Church."</p>
<p> In 1891 he was initiated into the Theta Delta Chi
Fraternity by the Kappa Charge. He is also a member of
the Universalist Club, and of the Joseph Warren Lodge of
Masons.</p>

<p>EDWIN AUGUSTUS START was born in North
Bridgewater (now Brockton), Massachusetts, June 1,
1863, his parents being the Rev. W. A. Start, of the Class of
'62, and Philena C. (Stevens) Start. He received his preliminary education in the schools of Melrose and Cambridge,
Massachusetts, graduating from the Cambridge High School
in 1880. He entered Tufts College in the Fall of the same
year, and graduated with the degree of A. B. in 1884.</p>
<p> Throughout his course he maintained a high rank in his
class, and was prominent in all student affairs. Endowed
with a large measure of dramatic ability, he often read in
public, sometimes furnishing entertainment for an entire
evening, while upon the college platform he won two first
prizes and one second prize in Oratory. During his Senior
year he was Editor-in-chief of the "Tuftonian," and at the
same time he revived the "Shield" of the Theta Delta
Chi Fraternity, continuing to edit it for a year after his
graduation.</p>
<p> After completing his college course Mr. Start spent some
months in historical study, and in teaching as substitute
Principal of a large school in Quincy, Massachusetts.
Deciding to make journalism his profession, he joined the
staff of the "Boston Daily Advertiser" in January, 1885.</p>
<p> He was married on September 9, 1885, to Julia Edith
Moor, daughter of the Rev. Clark R. Moor, of Cambridge,
Massachusetts.</p>
<p> During the ensuing year and a half Mr. Start served on
the "Advertiser" as reporter, night city editor, and special


<pb n="153" id="p.153"/>
correspondent. In the Spring of 1886 an overturn occurred
in the management, and several members of the staff left the
paper, Mr. Start being among the number. He then purchased the Franklin (Massachusetts) "Sentinel," which he
edited for a little less than a year, leaving Franklin in
February, 1887, to assume the associate editorship of the
Rutland (Vermont) Daily "Herald," then under the management of Col. Albert Clarke, formerly of the Boston "Advertiser," and now Secretary of the Home Market Club.</p>
<p> Mr. Start's health broke down under the long strain incident to a strike in the " Herald" office during the labor agitations of 1887, compelling him to give up all work for five
months. In May, 1888, having recovered his health, he
became president, editor, and manager of the "New England Observer," published at Keene, New Hampshire. As
an editor and as an orator he was active in the campaign of
1888, and pushed the "Observer" to a place in the front
rank of the New Hampshire press in point of influence.</p>
<p> In Cheshire County he was a prominent figure in the law
and order campaign which was vigorously pursued in New
Hampshire in 1888-89.</p>
<p> In 1889 Mr. Start became part owner, editor, and manager
of the Bellows Falls (Vermont) "Times."  At the close of
1889 the "Observer" was merged in an older rival, and a
few months later Mr. Start disposed of his interest in the
"Times," and became private secretary of the Hon. Carroll
S. Page, of Hyde Park, in his campaign for the Republican
nomination for the Governorship of Vermont. For the successful issue of this, - one of the hottest political canvasses
Vermont has known, -Mr. Page gave a large measure of
credit to his efficient secretary.</p>
<p> During the next few months Mr. Start devoted himself to
general literary work, contributing articles to the "New
England Magazine," and other periodicals. In June, 1891,
he became associate editor of the Daily " Press " at <pb n="154" id="p.154"/>
Middletown, New York, remaining there until the death of his wife
in January of the following year.</p>
<p> In the Spring of 1892 he spent some time in Virginia,
making a detailed study of the Hampton Institute and of
early Virginia history. A part of the results of this work
appeared in an article entitled "General Armstrong and the
Hampton Institute," which was first published in the "New
England Magazine," and subsequently printed separately and
given a wide circulation.</p>
<p> In May, 1892, Mr. Start was appointed Instructor in
History at Tufts College. He at once set about the difficult
task of organizing his department, and has been remarkably
successful in spite of a discouraging lack of facilities for
work.</p>
<p> He has taken an active interest in progressive educational
movements, and has done some effective work in the
advancement of the study of history outside the college.
The new curriculum was adopted by the Faculty in 1893
substantially as prepared by him for the committee of which
he was a member. Since that was adopted he has turned
his attention to securing a corresponding modification of
entrance requirements which will recognize the educational
value of a wider range of subjects. He secured the appointment, by the New England Association of Colleges and
Preparatory Schools, of a conference on college entrance
requirements in history, and as its secretary drafted the
detailed report, the recommendations of which were adopted
by the Association, subsequently received the unanimous endorsement of the Schoolmasters' Association of New York,
and have been made the basis of action by later conferences
and by college faculties.</p>
<p> During his first year as an Instructor Mr. Start found time
for a course of graduate study at Harvard, from which he
received the degree of A. M. in 1893. He is doing some
more advanced work in Cambridge at the present time. He


<pb n="155" id="p.155"/>
has contributed a large number of historical and other
articles to various periodicals. He was one of the sixteen
organization members of the Delta Chapter of Massachusetts of Phi Beta Kappa, and has been its Marshal since its
foundation. He was one of the organizers of the Twentieth
Century Club, in which he is very active. He is also a
member of the Appalachian Mountain Club, of the New
England Historic Genealogical Society, and of the Association of Guarantors of the American Historical Review.</p>

<head>THOMAS J. SAWYER, D.D., LL.D.</head>

<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.02739" id="f42"><head>Thomas J Sawyer</head></figure>
<p>THOMAS JEFFERSON SAWYER was born at Reading,
Windsor County, Vermont, January 9, 1804.</p>
<p> His education began in the district school, which he attended six months in the year until he was eighteen years of
age, when he began to teach, using the first money so earned
to pay for tuition at a private school kept at Reading by a
Universalist minister named Loveland. At nineteen he went
to Chester Academy, and thence, in 1825, to Middlebury College, a portion of his time while at each of these institutions
being devoted to teaching school.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, he had determined to enter the Universalist
ministry, and upon graduation from college in 1829, he at
once entered upon the study of theology with the Rev. W. S.
Balch, at Winchester, New Hampshire. The fact that within
a fortnight he received a Letter of Fellowship, and within a
month was ordained by the General Convention of New
England, indicates that his preparation was already considerable.</p>
<p> He remained at Winchester during the winter, preaching
some and studying much, and in April, 1830, went to New
York City and took charge of a small congregation worshipping in a chapel on Grand Street. In September of the
following year he was married to Miss Caroline M. Fisher, of
Newton, Massachusetts, whose writings have made her known
and beloved throughout the denomination. Mrs. Sawyer died
in 1894. Of seven children, two sons and a daughter are now
living.</p>
<p> In 1831 Mr. Sawyer became editor of the "Christian Messenger." In 1832 he hired for two years a church which had

<pb n="168" id="p.168"/>

been built on Orchard Street for a Dutch Reformed Society
which was unable to pay for it. This was a bold move, for
the rent of this building was considerably more than the total
expenses of the society previously. But the responsibility
was assumed by four of his parishioners, who were to receive
the whole income, first pay the rent, and then, if anything
was left, the pastor's salary. The fact that before the lease
expired the society purchased the building, shows that the
venture was justified. Here the young man preached and
worked with marked success until 1845, when he resigned
to accept the position of Principal of the Clinton Liberal
Institute, at Clinton, Oneida County, New York.</p>
<p> During this first pastorate in New York, Mr. Sawyer had
contributed mightily and in many ways to the strengthening, spreading, and popularizing of Universalism, not only in
the metropolis but throughout the country.  Theological
combats were the order in those days, and the Orchard Street
pulpit became famed for the strength, clearness, and reasonableness of its arguments for the larger faith. In discussion
and debate, in pamphlet and newspaper, as well as in sermon
and lecture, the aggressive, clear-headed, scholarly young
preacher labored incessantly and to good purpose. During
the cholera epidemic of 1832 he stood at his post, kept his
church open, and in many ways ministered to the afflicted.</p>
<p> In 1834 he was instrumental in organizing the Universalist
Historical Society of which he has ever since been Secretary
and Librarian, collecting during this time over three thousand volumes. In 1844 he prepared a plan of polity which is
substantially that by which the church has since been
governed. With all the rest, the busy pastor found time for
personal culture, beginning the study of German and Hebrew,
in both of which he became proficient.</p>
<p> In taking charge of the Institute at Clinton, Mr. Sawyer
also assumed the pastorate of the local church, and in addition to these duties, in view of the lack of a Universalist


<pb n="169" id="p.169"/>
theological school, he undertook to maintain a special course
in theology for the preparation of Universalist ministers.</p>
<p> Two or three hours a day were given to this work, and
thirty-seven men, among them some of the best known in the
denomination, here received their theological training. It
was while at Clinton that Mr. Sawyer, keenly alive to the
educational needs of the denomination, issued the call for the
convention held in New York in 1847, the outcome of which
was the founding of Tufts College, Canton Theological School,
and St. Lawrence University. Mr. Sawyer was president of
the first board of Trustees of each of these institutions.</p>
<p> In 1852 he returned to New York City, preaching one year
for the Fourth Society, and then resuming his first pastorate,
where he remained until the beginning of the war in 1861.</p>
<p> Then, after two years of work at his old Clinton home,
reading, writing, and preaching, he went again to New York
in 1863, as editor of the " Christian Ambassador," which position he held for three years. After this he spent three years
on a farm at Cateret, New Jersey, still preaching occasionally.</p>
<p> With the opening of Tufts Divinity School in 1869, Dr.
Sawyer was called to assume charge of it, with the title of
Packard Professor of Theology, and in 1882 he was formally
made Dean. In 1884 his impaired eyesight compelled him
to retire from active work as an instructor, and in 1892 he
was made Emeritus.</p>
<p> The degree of S. T. D. had been conferred upon him by
Harvard University, in 1850, and Tufts added that of LL. D.,
in 1895.  Twice he has been elected President of Tufts
College, once of Canton Theological School, and once of
Lombard University, but all these offices he has declined.
He is an honorary member of the chapter of Phi Beta Kappa
at Tufts.</p>
<p> The Rev. Richard Eddy, D. D., dedicates the second volume
of his history of Universalism in America to Dr. Sawyer,
saying, "his influence in shaping the thought of the <pb n="170" id="p.170"/>Universalist Church far exceeds that of any other living man." To
him belongs the honor of having given the initial impulse to
the first great undertaking of the denomination as a whole.</p>
<p> Dr. Sawyer at present resides with his daughter Alice, and
her husband, Professor Knight. He retains in his extreme
old age a remarkable degree of good health and vigor. His
intellect has lost none of its clearness, and his bearing is
still erect and full of dignity. Such an old age is beautiful
to look upon, as the ripened harvest of seed well sown.</p>

<p>CHARLES H. LEONARD was born at Northwood, New Hampshire, September 16, 1822. During his childhood
his parents removed to Haverhill, Massachusetts, where the
boy's education began, first in the common schools, and later
in the old Haverhill Academy, of which the famous Master
Taggart then had charge.   During his residence here he
taught school, a part of the time in the school-house made
famous by Whittier's "Snow-Bound," and here he first met
and became acquainted with the poet. On leaving the Academy he took the classical course afforded by Bradford Seminary at Bradford, Massachusetts, whence he went to Atkinson
Academy, where he pursued certain studies and acted as
assistant teacher.  After this he taught for four years at
Bradford, continuing some advanced studies under Master
Taggart and under a Mr. E. B. Morse, of Newburyport, who
then stood high as a teacher of history and philosophy.</p>
<p> The determination to enter the ministry dates from an early
age. The Congregational Church at first attracted him, but
before formally beginning his theological studies he had become a convert to Universalism. At this time the only
semblance of a theological school in connection with the
Universalist Church was the class conducted by Dr. Sawyer
at Clinton, New York. Here, in 1846, the young man went
and remained two years, at the end of which time he accepted
a call to the Universalist Society at Chelsea, Massachusetts.</p>
<p> For twenty-three years Mr. Leonard remained as pastor
of the Chelsea parish, achieving the most marked success.
Beginning with twenty families meeting for worship in an
obscure hall up two flights of stairs, the parish grew under


<pb n="172" id="p.172"/>

his care till at the close of his pastorate it numbered nearly
four hundred, and owned the building which still stands at
the corner of Chestnut and Fourth streets, unusually large
and elegant for those days. A Sunday-school of six hundred
members showed his success with the young people, and the
beautiful observance known as Children's Sunday, instituted
by him in 1856, has since been copied by societies of all denominations throughout the land.</p>
<p>  In the public affairs of the city Mr. Leonard always took
an active interest, serving for twenty-two years on the School
Board, and as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors largely
influencing the founding of the Chelsea High School.</p>
<p> At the beginning of his pastorate in 1848 he was married
to Miss Phebe Bassett, of Atkinson, New Hampshire. Mrs.
Leonard died in 1872. Of three children, a son and a daughter are now living: a second son died in early manhood. Mr.
Leonard spent the summer of 1858 travelling in Europe.</p>
<p> In 1869, with the opening of the Divinity School, Mr.
Leonard was called to assist Dr. Sawyer in its conduct, assuming the chair of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology,
but still retaining for two or three years an oversight of the
Chelsea society.  In 1884 Dr. Sawyer retired from active
service, and Dr. Leonard became the leader of the school,
although not formally installed as Dean until Dr. Sawyer was
made Emeritus in 1892. During his whole period of service
in the school, Dr. Leonard has had charge of the departments
of Homiletics and Pastoral Theology, as an instructor in
which branches he has gained a wide and enviable reputation, many claiming for him the first place in order of merit
among all the professors in the country.</p>
<p> But not merely in the class-room has Dr. Leonard worked
to advance the welfare of the school. In countless ways his
devotion to the institution which owes so much to him has
found and is constantly finding expression. Raising funds,
securing the establishment of professorships, promoting the


<pb n="173" id="p.173"/>
growth of the library, conducting a large correspondence with
ministers who constantly seek his counsel, devising means to
assist needy students, -these indicate but a few of the directions in which his activities are constantly employed in unselfish service to the Divinity School.</p>
<p> Dr. Leonard's exceptional ability has been recognized in
many ways: under Presidents Felton and Hill he served on
the Board of Examiners of Harvard College, and for many
years he was a member of the Examiner Club. He has also
long been a leader in the Minister's Club, an organization
composed of ministers - principally those connected with
educational institutions - living within a radius of ten miles
of Boston. The degree of A. M. was conferred upon him
by Tufts in 1869, and that of S. T. D. by St. Lawrence
University in 1881.</p>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="WILLIAM    G. TOUSEY, A. M., B. D." id="c5s3">
<head>WILLIAM G. TOUSEY, A. M., B. D.</head>

<p>      WILLIAM    GEORGE TOUSEY was born at Portage,
New York, September 22, 1842.   He was, by the
death of his father, early thrown on his own resources, which
seem to have consisted chiefly of a good moral character, a
determination to get an education, and a not very robust
physique.</p>
<p> The program of his early years was mainly made up of
hard work, - on a farm in summer, in the country schools
in winter. He soon found employment at teaching school,
however, and thus accumulated sufficient money to enable
him to enter the Nunda Literary Institute. It was during
his course there that the war broke out, and the young student, failing to get admission to the company which was
organized in his native village in response to the first call
for troops, hastened first to Philadelphia, and then to New


<pb n="174" id="p.174"/>
York, where he at last succeeded in obtaining a footing in
the Union navy. Having served out the term of his enlistment, principally in the Eastern Gulf Squadron, he resumed
his studies, and shortly after was made Principal of the
Nunda High School.</p>
<p> He resigned this position to enter Tufts College in the
Fall of 1865, but renewed his teaching during his college
life, being engaged one winter in Danvers and one in Medford.  He also increased his income by practising stenography, being noted in this, as in all else he undertook, for
remarkable accuracy. Although faithful, and to an exceptional degree successful in all departments of his college
work, the future professor's tastes found their most congenial
employment in those studies of which he has made himself
such a masterly instructor, - philosophy and the mental
sciences.</p>
<p> In his Junior year he was chosen anniversary orator of
the Mathetican Society, and among other honors achieved
during his course were a Junior prize in oratory and a Senior
prize for dissertation, his subject being characteristic: "The
Relation of &#x00C6;sthetics to Mental Development."</p>
<p> In athletics he took an active interest, becoming an adept
at fencing.  But his favorite recreation was, and still is,
yachting; he is a thorough Corinthian yachtsman, his summers being often spent in cruising along the New England
coast. His skill with a rifle, also, is well worthy of mention.</p>
<p> Graduating from the college in 1869, with the degree of
A. B., he at once entered the Divinity School, just opened,
he and three others composing its first class.</p>
<p> In 1872 he graduated with the degrees of A. M. and B. D.,
and accepted a call to Chelsea, the society so long presided
over by Dr. Leonard. His stay here was brief: the growth
of the Divinity School made another instructor necessary,
and Mr. Tousey was selected as the proper man for the place.
Accordingly, the opening of the school in 1872 found him


<pb n="175" id="p.175"/>
duly installed as Instructor in Psychology and Natural Theology, and in the catalogue of the following year his name
appears as Professor Tousey. Psychology, Logic, Ethics, and
the Philosophy of Theism are the studies through which he has
guided students with rare skill and tact. Professor Tousey
was one of the organizing members of Phi Beta Kappa at
Tufts.</p>
<p> In 1875 he was married to Miss Kate 0. Hall, of Cambridge,
and to them have been born a son and two daughters.</p>

<head>GEORGE T. KNIGHT, D. D.</head>

<p> GEORGE THOMPSON KNIGHT was born in Windham,
Maine, October 29, 1850.</p>
<p> His parents were farming people, the family a large one,
and the boy's early years were spent in hard work, with little
recreation.</p>
<p> His father was an Abolitionist and a Universalist, in the
days when it required courage to be either, and the rugged
strength of his character was his principal legacy to his
son.</p>
<p> With a natural taste for learning and a determination to
get it, George made the most of the few months each year
at the district school, and with this aid, still more by the help
of an elder sister, and most of all by his own faithful application, he fitted himself to enter Westbrook Seminary.</p>
<p> Here during several winter terms he studied, until at
seventeen he was fitted for college, and entered Tufts in the
Fall of 1868.</p>
<p> Here hard and faithful work not only overcame the deficiencies of his preparation, but put him, before he left the
college, in the first rank of his class. In the list of prize
awards in the catalogue appear two "firsts" in elocution
awarded to him.</p>
<p> In 1872 he graduated from the college, receiving the degree
of Bachelor of Arts, and in the Fall of the same year he
entered the divinity school as a member of the Junior class.</p>
<p> Here he remained three years, graduating in 1875, with
the degrees of Master of Arts and Bachelor of Divinity.</p>
<p> Immediately after graduation he was appointed Instructor
in Rhetoric and Church History, the duties of which position

<pb n="177" id="p.177"/>
he entered upon with the opening of the college year
1875-76.</p>
<p> We should fail to do justice to our subject if we neglected
to record his success in another field. For the recitation room
did not witness all his victories: some of his hardest-earned
laurels were won on the campus. He became a leader in
athletic affairs, especially in baseball, playing for four years
on the Varsity team with great distinction. But the honor
of being the best player in college was worn with characteristic modesty.</p>
<p> During his first year as an instructor, Mr. Knight taught
not only Rhetoric and Church History, but Biblical History
and Greek.</p>
<p> The "all-roundness" of his scholarship is shown by the
fact that during his twenty years of service he has taught,
either regularly or as a substitute, almost every branch now
taught in the school.</p>
<p> In 1876 he was ordained, and the next year he was married
to Miss Alice Sawyer, daughter of Dr. Sawyer, then senior
professor and Dean of the School. They have two sons and
two daughters, the elder of the latter being now a member
of the Freshman Class in the Course of Liberal Arts.</p>
<p> In 1883 Instructor Knight became Professor Knight, and
the following year he was made Secretary of the Faculty of
the Divinity School, a position which he still holds; discharging its numerous and trying duties with his characteristic
accuracy and care, in addition to his work as Professor of
Church History, and in the departments of Systematic Theology and Comparative Theology, of which he has charge.</p>
<p> Professor Knight was one of the first members of the local
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. In June, 1893, Lombard University conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Divinity.</p>
<p> Amid all his other duties Professor Knight has found time
for a large amount of literary work, attaining distinction
especially as a student of Ruskin.</p>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="GEORGE M. HARMON, A. M., B. D." id="c5s5">
<head>GEORGE M. HARMON, A. M., B. D.</head>

<p>GEORGE MILFORD HARMON was born in Thorndike,
Maine, November 28, 1842. His father was a farmer
with limited means; but in 1850 he removed his family to
Biddeford, where his children were given the advantages of
good schools.</p>
<p> Here the boy became acquainted with many of the men who
were interested in the founding of the new college in Medford,
among them the Rev. Dr. James P. Wiston, then principal of
Westbrook Seminary, who appealed to the boy's natural desire
for learning, and urged him to shape his thought toward a college course. But the means for such an undertaking seemed to
be beyond his reach, and the desire remained such only, until,
in the High School, he came under the influence of Mr.
Edward A. Rand, now an Episcopal clergyman in Watertown,
Massachusetts. An excellent teacher, kindly, energetic, and
faithful, Mr. Rand encouraged a large class of boys to fit for
college. Most of them entered Bowdoin, but young Harmon
preferred Tufts, which he entered in 1863.</p>
<p> On graduating in 1867, the Divinity School not having yet
been established, he entered at once upon his work as a minister
in the town of Rochester, Vermont.</p>
<p> But Mr. Harmon felt the need of more thorough professional
training, and the feeling grew with every year he spent in his
work. So, after preaching three years in Vermont and two
in Michigan, he resigned his pastorate and returned for a
three years' course in divinity at Tufts. After graduating
in 1875 he settled over the church at Adams, Massachusetts.
Here he was married to a young lady of his own name, in
1876, and they now have three children. In 1880 he removed
to Peabody, Massachusetts, and in 1882 to Galesburg, Illinois,
where he was called to the double office of pastor of the
church and teacher in the newly-established theological de

<pb n="179" id="p.179"/>
partment of Lombard University. He remained here till
1884, when he was called to teach in the Divinity School of
Tufts College. After Dr. Sawyer relinquished all active work
in the class-room, both the theological and Biblical subjects
fell to Professor Harmon, and when Theology and Old Testament subjects passed into other hands New Testament Exegesis
and Theology remained in his charge, and these are his
special subjects in the present apportionment of the theological course.</p>
<p> Professor Harmon was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1893.</p>

<p>ANSON BARTIE CURTIS was born in the township of
Tompkins, Michigan, December 11, 1863. His father
was a farmer, and would have been glad had his son been
content to follow the same pursuit.  But farming had no
attractions for young Bartie, whose literary tastes began to
develop at an early age. When seven years old he was sent
to the district school, where he soon mastered all that the
local teachers were capable of imparting. At fifteen he was
prepared for college in several branches; and now thoroughly
convinced that farming was not his sphere, his parents sent
him to the High School at Jackson, twelve miles from home.
Here he took at once both the Classical and English courses,
besides doing in the latter half of his last year a full year's
work in Hebrew as a member of Professor Harper's correspondence class.  Notwithstanding all this extra work, he
relaxed none of his characteristic thoroughness, and during
his course at Jackson always held the highest rank in his
class.</p>
<p> It was during his last year at Jackson that young Curtis
decided to become a minister of the Gospel, and it was this
determination which led him to take up the study of Hebrew,
of which mention has been made. In this study he became
an enthusiast, and pursued it diligently, by correspondence,
by attendance on Professor Harper's summer schools, and by
hard personal work.</p>
<p> In the Fall of 1884 he entered the University of Michigan,
where he remained three years, earnestly working with the
thought of the ministry constantly before him. A weekly
Bible class of students conducted by him is spoken of in the
highest terms.</p>


<pb n="181" id="p.181"/>

<p> During his Senior year a class in Hebrew was formed with
Mr. Curtis as instructor, a position for which he was highly
recommended by Professor Harper, then at Yale.  During
his college life, the young man began to feel that his religious
sympathies were with the liberal church, but he put away
such ideas at first, and looked to a course at Yale or Andover
Theological School to settle his convictions on their old
foundations.</p>
<p> In 1887 he graduated with the degree of A. B., and for
four months preached to a Congregationalist parish at Grand
Ledge, where he was urged to remain as pastor. But Professor Harper induced him to go to Yale, where he remained
for a year, dividing his time between Hebrew and philosophy.
But he found himself getting farther and farther away from
orthodoxy, and his parents, unwilling to encourage such
"heresy," withdrew their support.  His proficiency in Hebrew and Greek now served him well, for two theological
schools offered to pay his current expenses in return for his
teaching classes in those branches. Under this arrangement
he went to the Unitarian school at Meadville, Pennsylvania,
where he remained one year, teaching six hours a week, and
doing sufficient work to obtain the'degrees of B. D. and A. M.,
which were conferred upon him in 1889. The next year he
received from Allegheny College the degree of Ph. D., which
he had earned by a two years' course in philosophy.</p>
<p> While at Meadville he became settled in his religious convictions, and having finished his course there accepted a call
to a liberal church at Big Rapids, Michigan, where he remained one year, when he was invited to the position of
Instructor in Hebrew and the Old Testament at the Tufts
Divinity School.  Here he began his work in the Fall of
1890, and in 1894 received his professorship.</p>
<p> In 1889, after leaving Meadville, Dr. Curtis was married
to Miss Mae Christie, and they now have two children. Professor Curtis for several years has been a prolific writer,


<pb n="182" id="p.182"/>
contributing articles, mostly on Old Testament subjects, to
many of the leading papers of the country. His first book,
"Back to the Old Testament," appeared in 1894.</p>

<p>WARREN  S. WOODBRIDGE was born in Arlington,
Massachusetts, December 25, 1851.  His father is
Samuel F. Woodbridge, the founder of the Woodbridge Professorship of Applied Christianity, of which the subject of
this sketch is the first incumbent. In 1861 the family removed to North Cambridge, and Warren received his education in the Cambridge public schools, graduating from the
High School in 1870. He at once entered Tufts, where, at
the end of his Freshman year, he received two first prizes,
one in reading and one in Latin prose composition. He was
a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity, and an editor of the
"Tuftonian" during one year. Of athletics base-ball was his
favorite, he playing on the Varsity nine one season. In 1874
he graduated at the head of his class, receiving the degree
of A. B., and in the Fall of the same year he entered the
Divinity School, from which he graduated in 1877.  The
following November he was married to Miss Elizabeth May
Gerry, of Cambridge, and settled as pastor of the Universalist Church at Orona, Maine. After a pastorate here of
two and a half years, Mr. Woodbridge accepted a call to
Adams, Massachusetts, where he remained nine years, till
April, 1889, when he was called to the Universalist Church
in Medford. He served here nearly five years, resigning in
1894 to accept the appointment to the Divinity School Faculty. He spent the next year in a tour of observation and
study in England and on the Continent, maturing plans for

year.</p>
<p> In the literary field Professor Woodbridge is the author of
"Christ in the Life," one of the Manuals of Faith and Duty
issued by the Universalist Publishing House, and has contributed articles to the "Universalist Quarterly" and the
"Christian Leader." He has served for five years as a trustee of the Universalist State Convention, and has been several
times a delegate to the General Convention. For three years
he has been chairman of the Missionary Committee of the
State Convention, and for eight years a trustee of the Universalist Publishing House, being at present one of its Board

<head>THE ZETA PSI FRATERNITY AND THE KAPPA CHAPTER</head>
<p>THE Zeta Psi Fraternity is a child of the Masonic Order,
as it was founded by members of that brotherhood
who naturally incorporated into the new fraternity many
characteristic features of their own.</p>
<p> The honor of establishing the society is due to John B.
Yates Somers, John M. Skillman, and William Henry Dayton,
who founded it in 1846, at the University of New York.</p>
<p> From this small beginning have sprung thirty different
chapters, of which number twenty are very prosperous to-day.</p>
<p> The Kappa Chapter at Tufts was the eleventh to be
granted a charter. In 1855, the Hon. Robert M. Morse, Jr.,
and the Hon. J. L. Flagg, formerly Mayor of Troy, N. Y.,
members of the Rho Chapter at Harvard, founded the Kappa,
entrusting to Benjamin A. Hathaway, of Tufts, the task of
choosing the charter members. He soon chose six other
men who were initiated a few weeks later at Harvard, thus
making the Kappa the oldest fraternity chapter at Tufts
College.</p>
<p> The first meeting was held in the room of Henry B. Brown
and John C. Redman, in October, 1855, and meetings continued to be held there till June, 1856. It was during the
second year of the Kappa's existence that a room was
obtained in a wooden story-and-a-half house just east of the
bridge. This room, however, was used but a short time, and
the chapter moved into quarters on Main St., Medford, where
it remained till fire destroyed the property of the fraternity
in 1860.</p>

<pb n="208" id="p.208"/>

<p> The Civil War broke out at about the same time, calling all
but two of the members of the chapter to fight for their
country. Among those whose names are on the Roll of
Honor are Benjamin Allen Hathaway, Herman Joseph Smith,
and Lieutenant Henry Bowers Walton, who was killed in the
battle at Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864, from the class of
'58; Colonel Thomas Orville Seaver, Brigadier-General Selden
Connor from the class of '59; George Curtis Waldo, Lieutenant Lorin L. Dame, and Captain Oliver Hawkes Lowell, from
the class of '60. Captain Lowell was wounded at Gettysburg,
July 1, 1863, and died the following day. Lieutenant Colonel
Philo Hersy is the only representative of the class of '61 on
the Roll. From the class of '62 are the names of Lieutenant
Albion Thorne, Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Heald, and
Elbridge Hazen Dearborn; while Lieutenant Horatio Bisbee,
Lieutenant Rienzi Loud, and Henry Lyon represent the class
of '63.</p>
<p> Owing to so many being at the front no more men were
initiated until 1864.</p>
<p> During the war most of the meetings were probably held on
the Hill although some were held in the vestry of the Universalist Church at Medford. In 1865 the chapter moved into
rooms in Usher's Block, Medford, where it remained until
rooms were taken in Odd Fellows Hall, North Cambridge, in
1894, where are the present quarters of the fraternity.</p>
<p> A meeting of the Grand Chapter is held annually, two of
which have been held in Boston; the first time in 1875 when
Zebulon White of the Kappa delivered the oration. At the
urgent request of the Kappa Chapter the Grand Chapter
again held the annual convention in Boston in 1883.</p>
<p> Associations of the Alumni have been formed in various
parts of the country, the one nearest Tufts being the New
England Division with headquarters in Boston.</p>

<div3 type="section" n="THE THETA DELTA CHI FRATERNITY AND THE KAPPA CHARGE." id="c7s2s1">
<head>THE THETA DELTA CHI FRATERNITY AND THE KAPPA CHARGE.</head>
<p>IN 1846 six students of Union College, Schenectady, New
York, decided to band themselves together and form a
fraternity. These six men were William G. Akin, Abel
Beach, Theodore B. Brown, Andrew H. Green, William
Hyslop, and Samuel F. Wile. They associated with themselves Robert L. Dodge, Theodore J. Fonda, Jesse D. Fonda,
Francis E. Martindale, Newton B. Sherman, and Abram
Walrath; and on June 5, 1847 the Alpha Charge of the Theta
Delta Chi Fraternity was established. Of the twelve men
whose names are recorded above only four are now living,-
Messrs. Beach, Dodge, Green, and Martindale.</p>
<p>  While the policy of the fraternity was, from the first, one of
judicious extension, the Alpha Charge, retaining the government in its own hands, exercised a close restrictive supervision over every charge which it chartered. At first this
oligarchical government worked well; but as the organization grew in size a democratic tendency began to show itself;
and while no friction took place, the feeling that the fraternity should be governed by some sort of general representation rapidly gained ground. At length, in 1867, the Alpha
Charge, owing to the decayed condition of Union College, was
dissolved; and in 1868 the annual convention vested the
government in a Grand Lodge, consisting of one graduate and
two undergraduate members, the same to be elected annually
by delegates from the charges assembled in convention.</p>
<p>  Up to the present writing the existence of Theta Delta Chi
has been, on the whole, calm and prosperous. The Civil War

<pb n="212" id="p.212"/>

dealt the only serious blow which it has received; but this
was serious indeed, as the fraternity was especially strong in
its southern charges. The names of many of the noblest of
southern gentlemen are to be found upon the rolls of the
extinct charges of William and Mary College and the various
southern universities, which flourished before the war as
never since. Many gallant officers and soldiers of both North
and South were Theta Delts, the honor roll of the fraternity
being very large. A great number of important civil posts
were also held by members of the brotherhood during those
stirring times.</p>
<p>  Within the last few years the fraternity, hitherto strictly
conservative (that is to say, confining itself to the eastern
colleges), has been carefully feeling its way westward, and
has instituted charges at the Universities of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>  Theta Delta Chi publishes a quarterly magazine, the
"Shield," which is at present edited by Clay W. Holmes, of
Elmira, New York. The present officers of the Grand Lodge,
elected at the convention of November, 1895, are Carl A. Harstrom, President; B. F. Mansfield, Secretary; and J. H.
Morse, Treasurer.</p>
<p>  The Kappa Charge of Theta Delta Chi was established at
Tufts College in the year 1856 by Augustus E. Scott, who
was a member of the Zeta Charge at Brown, and entered the
class of '58 at Tufts in its Sophomore year. He associated
with himself Winsor B. French, Obed C. Turner, and William
E. Gibbs, of the class of '59, and Elmer H. Capen, Horatio
McIntire, Elam Porter, Benjamin K. Russ, and Oscar G. Sawyer, of the class of '60. Of these all but Messrs. Turner,
Porter, and Sawyer, are now living.</p>
<p>  Kappa enjoys the distinction of being the oldest charge of
the fraternity which has had a continuous existence; and
there has never been a year since its establishment when at
least one of its members has not been honorably graduated.

                <pb n="213" id="p.213"/>

To this charge was due the revival of the "Shield" in 1883.
The magazine had been dead for some years, but under the
editorship of Edwin A. Start, '84, and the business management of E. W. Powers, '81, it sprang into new life, and has
since held a place in the front rank of fraternity journalism.</p>
<p>  At the outbreak of the war Kappa contributed liberally to
the Union forces, and among the names upon the roll of
honor are those of General W. B. French, '59, who with his
regiment was the first to gain the heights of Fredericksburg;
Judge J. W. Hammond, '61; General J. C. Graves, Chaplain
W. A. Start, and E. H. Richards, '62; Captain L. E. Monroe,
who was killed while leading a desperate charge before
Petersburg on July 30,1864, and J. B. Brewster, '63; Captain
A. C. Fish, S. J. Hill, and E. Fitzgerald, '64; J. M. Baker,
W. C. Ireland, and W. E. Savery, '65; E. D. Howe and E.
A. Perry, '67; and Roland Hammond, '68. O. G. Sawyer, '60,
served as war correspondent for the New York " Herald."</p>
<p>  Kappa has always held a place of honor in the fraternity,
and has been represented upon the Grand Lodge by H. H.
Eddy, '76, as Secretary in 1875, and as President in 1877 and
1878; by R. H. Eddy, '80, as Treasurer in 1879, and Secretary
in 1880; and by F. E. Kimball, as Treasurer in 1891.</p>
<p>  In 1893 a commodious house was erected for the charge
at No. 123 Packard Avenue, from designs by the Boston
architect, J. P. Rinn, and now forms one of the centres of
social life on the Hill.</p>

<head>THE DELTA UPSILON FRATERNITY AND THE TUFTS CHAPTER.</head>
<p>THE Delta Upsilon was founded at Williams College
Nov. 4, 1834. Its aim has been to secure the union of
college men of kindred tastes for the promotion of social,
intellectual, and moral culture on an open basis. Its aims
may differ little perhaps from those apparently professed by
the secret college fraternities, but it is in its conduct toward
outsiders that its position is unique.</p>
<p>  The Delta Upsilon fraternity is an open non-secret organization. By these words " open and non-secret" is not meant
that the proceedings of its meetings are to be published in the
college papers or that its meetings are open to all, with or
without invitation. It means however that the fraternity constitution is open to all who care to read it, that no man joins
the fraternity knowing nothing of what the final pledge is, and
that the pledge puts on the initiate no obligation to keep from
any one information regarding the chapter or fraternity that
he may wish to impart.</p>
<p>  Chapters have been established in nearly all the colleges of
the United States, and after sixty-one years of vigorous life
Delta Upsilon has at present twenty-nine chapters.</p>
<p>  The Tufts chapter was established Dec. 4, 1886. The
founding of the chapter grew out of the general dissatisfaction
among the more influential non-society men with the political
and social condition of the college; and from a well-grounded
fear that a second-rate secret society would be established
and make the situation worse. Communication was opened
with the Harvard chapter of Delta Upsilon, and on June 15,


<pb n="218" id="p.218"/>

1886, a petition for a charter signed by thirteen men was forwarded to the Executive Council of the Fraternity. On the
advice of the Harvard chapter the Tufts men sent delegates
to the general convention held at New York, Nov. 1886. At
this convention a charter was granted to the Tufts men. The
initiation ceremonies took place at the Quincy House, December 4, 1886. The Charter Members were Wilson Q. Fairbanks, Henry W. Hayes, Frank O. Melcher, Alva C. Snow,
Clemente Valdes, True W. White, from the class of '87; Lewis
D. Coburn, Clarance A. Crooks, Frank W. Durkee, Chas. H.
Murdock, George F. Murdock, Frederick H. Swift, from the
clsss of '88; William B. Eddy, Clarence F. French, John S.
Lamson, Burdett H. Loomis, Herbert O. Maxham, from the
class of '89; and Frederick T. Nelson, from the class of '90.</p>
<p> Although but nine years old Delta Upsilon holds its own
among the older institutions of its kind at the college. In
the summer of '94 a spacious chapter house was built on
Sawyer Avenue. This house contains, in addition to seven
suites for studies and chambers, parlors, dining-room and
kitchen, billiard and bath rooms.</p>

<pb n="222" id="p.222"/>
<p>THE Delta Tau Delta Fraternity was founded in 1859 at
       Bethany College to lead the opposition to the strong
influence in college affairs exerted by the chapter of Phi
Kappa Psi. It soon accomplished its first purpose and in a
short time established chapters in Jefferson College, West
Liberty College, and Morgantown Academy.</p>
<p>  Scarcely had this work been accomplished, when the opening of the Civil War caused all of these colleges, except Jefferson, to close their doors, the students, for the most part,
entering the armies that struggled for the possession of the
country. Jefferson, being outside the seat of war, was spared,
and as the parent chapter had ceased to exist, the Jefferson
chapter assumed charge of the affairs of the Fraternity. The
next ten years were marked by vigorous growth, and considering that this period covered the years of the Civil War, which
so seriously crippled so many of the educational institutions
of the country, the progress was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>  The second decade was begun under the reign of Chapter
Mu at Ohio Wesleyan, whose sway lasted from 1869 to 1874.
During this time the Fraternity made rapid strides and established chapters in nearly all the leading educational institutions in the North Central States.</p>
<p>  In 1874 the government was intrusted to Alpha at Alleghany, which continued to administer the affairs of the Fraternity until 1883, when a new constitution was adopted, which
unified the government and vested the chief authority in a
representative body called the Arch Chapter. Since this time
 <pb n="223" id="p.223"/>

the prosperity of the Fraternity has had no break, and it has
won a name and place for itself among the leading scholastic
fraternities of the land. In 1886 the southern fraternity
known as the Rainbow or W. W. W. Society was united with
Delta Tau Delta.</p>
<p>  The interests of Delta Tau Delta have been ably furthered
by the publication of its magazine. This was commenced as
a monthly in 1877, under the direction of W. C. Buchanan.
It was called the Crescent from one of the emblems of the
Fraternity. After the first volume, it was published by
Alpha until 1884, since which time it has been under the care
of the Arch Chapter. In 1886 the name was changed to
"The Rainbow" in honor of the fraternity of that name
which allied itself with Delta Tau at this time. The Fraternity has published five editions of its catalogue. With the
exception of the last which was published by Rho in 1885, the
chapter in chief authority has issued the catalogue.</p>
<p>  In the Spring of 1889, Beta Mu, the branch of Delta Tau
Delta at Tufts College, was founded by the efforts of Elmer
J. Felt, D. S., '91, who had been a member of the Fraternity at
Buchtel. Early in its career it occupied rooms at Medford
Hillside, but in March, 1893, it opened the first chapter-house
on the Hill. At the opening of the college year of 1895, Beta
Mu moved to its present quarters on Curtis Street.</p>
<p>  Beta Mu has generously supported all college interests,
both by the active participation of her members and by her
influence. She has kept before the eyes of her members the
principle that affection for their Fraternity brings loyalty to
their Alma Mater. She has constantly aimed to gather as her
members the best types of college men, and by steady adherence to this principle, she has won the respect and esteem of
the fraternities with which she is in friendly rivalry.</p>

<head>THE ALPHA TAU OMEGA FRATERNITY AND THE GAMMA BETA CHAPTER.</head>

<p>JUST after the close of the war when everything was in a
    state of turmoil three students of the Virginia Military
Academy thought it would be an admirable plan to organize a
national fraternity which should act as a connecting link
between the North and the South.</p>
<p>  The idea was carried out, and the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity was formed on September 11, 1865, at Richmond, Virginia. The chapter at the Military Institute, of course, became
the most active and the first in importance.</p>
<p>  Although intended as a national organization, it was not
until quite recently that many chapters were established in
Northern Colleges; and the main idea or plan of the first
members bids fair to be carried out even beyond their
expectations.</p>
<p>  The government of the Fraternity consists of three departments, viz., a Congress of delegates from  colleges, which
meets twice a year; the Grand Officers of the Fraternity, and
a High Council consisting of five members chosen from the
Fraternity at large by the Congress; and the Worthy High
Chancellor, who acts judicially and settles all disputed
questions.</p>
<p>  The Fraternity's official organ is the " Alpha Tau Omega
Palm," which was established in 1880 and stands high among
the fraternity publications. Since 1888 the magazine has
been published in New York, but before that time was published in several other places. There are a number of Alumni
associations all of which are in a prosperous condition, the
<pb n="228" id="p.228"/>

one in Washington being the principal. There are forty-five
active chapters and the Gamma Beta of Tufts is almost the
youngest of them.</p>
<p>  The Gamma Beta chapter was established in 1893; and
since then its growth has been marvellous, and at the present
time it is in a very flourishing and solid condition both financially and in numbers. It is the only chapter of "Alpha
Tau" in Massachusetts, although there are chapters in Maine,
Vermont, and Rhode Island. In October, 1895, an Alumni
association to be called the Boston Alumni Association was
founded, and has its headquarters in Boston.</p>

<head>ALPHA DELTA SIGMA.</head>
<p>THE local Greek letter society known as Alpha Delta
       Sigma was organized by six young ladies of Tufts College in the Fall of 1895, and is not the outcome of hasty or
immature plans. Its existence was conceived before the close
of the last college year, and during the summer, plans were
made for its establishment and promotion.</p>
<p>  During the first month of the present college year, the aims
and purposes of the society were definitely decided in preliminary meetings; and by the third week in October, a constitution and by-laws had been adopted, and a general outline for
the work of the ensuing year agreed upon.</p>
<p>  The first initiation was held November 14th, when eight
young women were received into membership, making a total
of fourteen. A second initiation took place on December 9th,
when the roll of members was increased to fifteen.</p>
<p>  While the organization and method of the society are secret,
it nevertheless is established on a broad and liberal basis and
aims to be an agency for stimulating right activities. Its
brief existence has borne ample testimony to the belief of its
founders, that the scope of college life among the women
of Tufts would be materially broadened and enriched by a
harmony of personal interests. In the furtherance of the
aims of their society its members firmly believe that they
have at heart the best interests of the individuals enrolled as
well as of the institution to which they belong; and by faithful and earnest adherence to the principles of its foundation,
the members of Alpha Delta Sigma hope to secure for their
society an honorable standing among college sororities.</p>

<head>ALPHA KAPPA GAMMA.</head>
<p>EVER since the admission of girls to the college the matter of secret societies has been discussed. Alpha Kappa
Gamma can trace its beginning back to 1893, when it was
first spoken of.</p>
<p>  Nothing definite was done, however, for some time, on
account of the small number of girls in the college.</p>
<p>  In 1895 the number had so far increased as to make the
idea practicable. Accordingly, in the Fall of the same year
Alpha Kappa Gamma was established as a local society. The
charter members were Mabel Prescott Bailey, Isabelle Gertrude Knight, Edith Louise Hodge, Harriette Alice Turner,
Clara Ransom, Marion Lenore Flint, Harriette Johnson
Merrill, and Ellen Eddy Shaw.</p>

<head>THE HETH ALEPH RES FRATERNITY: DIVINITY SCHOOL.</head>
<p>SEVERAL years prior to the formation of this fraternity,
     the need of such an organization had been felt by the
students of the Divinity School. In the Spring of 1891 the
matter of forming a Hebrew-letter society was much discussed; and in the Fall of the same year several preliminary
meetings were held, resulting in definite organization on the
evening of October fifth.</p>
<p>  Since its organization the young society has thriven well.
As the college year of 1895 drew to a close steps were taken
to provide the fraternity with a home of its own, and the next
Fall found it ensconced in a comfortable house on Sawyer
Avenue.</p>
<p>  Heth Aleph Res has a field of usefulness peculiarly its own.
Its membership is confined entirely to students of the Theological School, and it fills a place there similar to that of the
Greek-letter fraternities in the college. Its aims are high, its
influence is good, and its activity is constant. It has been
clearly shown that its tendency is toward raising the standards
of student life in the school.</p>

<p>THE Alpha Kappa Kappa Society was organized by several students of the Dartmouth Medical School in 1888.  It is strictly a medical society, its aims being the advancement of Medical Science and the promotion of good fellowship.</p>
<p>The Beta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Kappa is located at the University of Vermont.  The Gamma Chapter was instituted at the Tufts Medical School during the Spring term of 1894, Professor Charles P. Thayer standing as its godfather.  It has grown steadily, and fully realized the expectations of its founders.  It at present occupies rooms on Boylston Place, but is soon to move into more commodious quarters.  The meetings of the Chapter are held bi-monthly.</p>

<p>THE Alpha Delta Society was founded at the Tufts Medical School in April, 1894, previous to which time no
society of any sort had existed among the women of the
school. The charter members numbered twelve. All women
students at the Tufts Medical School are eligible for membership. The objects of the society are the promotion of good
fellowship among its members and the furthering of the usefulness and the interests of all women in the medical profession. Fortnightly meetings are held, at which papers on
scientific and medical subjects are read and discussed, the
program being filled out by musical and literary entertainment and social enjoyment.  A very successful beginning
has been made, and much good work may be expected from
the society as its membership is enlarged and its plans
developed.</p>
